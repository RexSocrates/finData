food culture it s going to be good Mollet eggs rhymes with Ol\u00e9 are wonderfully soft eggs with a firm egg white and a beautiful oozy center They re not what we would generally call a soft egg with it s more liquid albumin I ve been obsessed with these eggs for the last two months By obsessed I mean I ve eaten at least one for breakfast or lunch almost every day And can I just mention how brilliant they are this time of year If you re using organic free range chicken eggs you ll see the yolks are almost orange right now as the birds get out and take in those nutritients Happy chickens means a happy me I ll put an egg on most anything Put an egg on it is my Put a bird on it Portlandia anyone I don t always like to use oil when I prepare eggs so that leaves me with the options of either hard boiled which I make often or poached And more often than not I m too lazy to poach them I ve found that mollet eggs are the perfect solution This technique which I first saw used by that French culinary sage Jacques Pepin is foolproof First bring a saucepan of water to a boil Use a pin or thumbtack to poke a hole into the largest end of the egg This hole prevents the egg shell from cracking while it s cooking Boil the eggs for six minutes and then pour out the water Shake the pan to crack the shells a bit Finally peel the eggs under cold running water The water gets under the shell and membrane causing it to slough off without taking any of the firm egg white The egg is perfect every time Now the egg is only part of this breakfast dish We love hash the perfect big breakfast to start the weekend It s even better when you have friends come over to enjoy it with I make the pork shoulder in a crock pot though of course you can just use your oven and braise the pork shoulder if you like One of the things I love about this meal is that most of it can be made in advance Much of the morning can be spent visiting and sipping on a cup of French press coffee I love being able to make most of this meal ahead of time it makes the morning so much more relaxing And even better the leftovers if you somehow have any heat up very well and make a fine lunch Here s to your next weekend breakfast The Recipe Mollet Eggs with Pork Shoulder Hash serves 6 comfortably 4 tablespoons olive oil 6 cloves garlic 2 sprigs rosemary 1 teaspoon dried thyme 1 2 3 4 cup water 1 large white onion chopped plus another 1 2 onion 3 pounds organic fingerling potatoes steamed then diced 3 celery ribs chopped 2 pounds pork shoulder 1 4 cup chopped fresh chives 6 organic eggs or more kosher salt and fresh black pepper To make the pork shoulder The night before you plan to serve it place the pork shoulder seasoned with kosher salt and fresh black pepper 1 2 white onion cut into chunks garlic cloves 1 rosemary sprig thyme and 1 2 cup of water or a bit more if you see fit into a crock pot set at low Leave on overnight In the morning remove the meat and and shred it with two forks discarding any fat Add the soft garlic cloves to the meat Set aside Prepare the potatoes the night before as well Add the potatoes to a large saucepan with a steamer inserted into it Set the heat to medium high and cover with a lid If they don t all fit into your pan steam them in two batches Steam for 10 15 minutes depending upon the size of your potatoes or until a knife inserted into them goes in with ease Let cool and place them covered in the refrigerator overnight Dice them in the morning In the morning heat a large skillet mine is 14 inches to medium high heat Add the olive oil and then saut\u00e9 the onion until it develops a nice golden color about 5 7 minutes Add the celery and saut\u00e9 until it softens a bit Sprinkle kosher salt and fresh black pepper into the pan Add the diced potatoes and cook until they are heated through and have developed a bit of a golden color to them Add the shredded pork shoulder to the pan and continue to saut\u00e9 until everything is hot Re season if necessary Sprinkle with chives and chop up the remaining rosemary sprig and add that as well Meanwhile while the potatoes are cooking bring a medium saucepan filled with water to a boil When the potatoes are on the verge of being done gently push a pin or thumbtack into the large end of each of the eggs Gently lower them into the boiling water Reduce the heat to a small boil Set a timer for six minutes When the timer goes off remove from heat Drain the hot water into sink leaving the eggs in the pan Gently but with a bit of force shake the pan back and forth so that the eggs crack a bit Run some cold water and begin to peel the eggs underneath it It is important to get the water under the shell and the membrane Once that occurs peeling the egg will be a cinch Dry the eggs on a paper towel Have the pork shoulder hash plated and place one egg or more on the top Cut into the egg and enjoy the golden yolk oozing all over the crisp potatoes and pork shoulder Enjoy Thanks

Northern California "",""body"":""The United States of Pizza Where to Eat Pizza in California Part 1 Northern California Posted by Adam Kuban April 18 2010 at 5 00 PM And it s back Once again it s been a while since we dropped an installment of this 50 part series on you Today we begin the C s with California Yeah it s a doozy so we split it in two Northern and Southern Let s get this show on the road The Mgmt Bay Area Quick Overview OK I m not even going to pretend that this is a comprehensive list of all the Northern California pizzerias worthy of your attention The rate at which new places are opening there and the geographic vastness make this a crazy undertaking to be sure And yes in fact this will encompass mostly Bay Area pizzerias since these are the places that both L A Pizza Maven LAPM and I have eaten at But that s the great thing about the Comments section below If we ve missed your favorite place you can set our butts straight and give us the real dope Anyway As LAPM points out in many of his posts on Slice the Bay Area pizza scene has caught fire in the last decade and is a far cry from when he lived there in the 80s Heck it s a far cry from what it was when I started Slice almost seven years ago in 2003 It s funny because even in 2005 when Ed Levine s book Pizza A Slice of Heaven came out he wrote that California is on the whole a lousy pizza state That s decidedly untrue today what with all the Neapolitan influenced wood fired oven joints cramming the scene But speaking of WFO joints as much as they re sprouting up like weeds Ed points out that the state s first pizzeria was a wood fired joint called Lupo s founded in 1935 in San Francisco s North Beach neighborhood Lupo s became Tommaso s in 1971 when Frankie Cantalupo got out of the business and sold the place to his longtime pizzaman Tommy Chin with the provision that Chin change the name Chin was no dummy Ed writes He knew that a pizzeria named Chin s was going to have a rough time attracting customers so he renamed it Tommaso s which was Cantalupo s nickname for him So I suppose Tommaso s might be a good place to start Here s Ed on the joint Tommaso s SF s Original Wood Fired Oven Pizzeria Photograph joeywan on Flickr Agostino Crotti whose family bought Tommaso s from Tommy Chin in 1973 is a dedicated pizzaiolo and restaurateur Every night customers see him tending to the 70 year old wood burning oven in the right hand corner of the restaurant He s a hard working man turning out an honest pie the crust has a nice yeasty flavor and a fine raised lip and flattens out considerably the further toward the center of the pie you go leaving the crust a little gummy the Italian sausage from Molinari s down the street is a little bland I love sitting in one of the white wooden booths that line both sides of Tommaso s ordering a pizza and staring at the murals while I wait for my pie Tommaso s doesn t make the pizza of my dreams but if you want a slice of California pizza history it s a destination Ed Levine Tomasso s 1042 Kearny Street San Francisco CA 94133 map 415 398 9696 tommasos com Stuffed Pizza and Deep Dish Zachary s and Little Star Zachary s Oakland location and one of its stuffed pizzas Photographs exterior zacharys com pizza Neil Conway OK I ll admit it I have not yet tried the stuffed pizzas at either Zachary s Chicago Pizza commonly known as just Zachary s or Little Star but for people who love the stuffed or deep dish styles well those people in the Bay Area seem to be nutso about these places I m not quite sure if there s a hardcore rivalry going \u00e0 la Frank Pepe s vs Sally s Apizza in New Haven Connecticut but I do know folks who are either really into one or the other And I know Ed Levine here at Slice Serious Eats prefers Little Star to Zachary s Follow slice on Twitter Friend Slice on Facebook Zachary s was founded in 1983 on College Avenue in Oakland by Zach Zachowski and Barbara Gabel both Wisconsin natives who had spent some time in Chicago picking up a love of stuffed pizza there before finding themselves in the Bay Area They now have three locations one opened a year later in Berkeley and the third in San Ramon in 2006 Pies at Zachary s are stuffed which means a layer of dough in a deep dish pan followed by cheese and other ingredients what would otherwise be called toppings and then another layer of dough followed by sauce Like the thick Chicago style pizza it is it takes 30 to 40 minutes to bake The place is usually crowded and the Oakland and Berkeley locations are first come first served So if there s a table wait they ll take your order while you wait so that it s ready by the time you sit down Additionally a lot of my Bay Area friends who frequent Zachary s actually say they call ahead for the half baked pizzas there You can order them in advance bring them home and finish them off in your oven Also additionally finally Zachary s does serve a thin crust pizza Zachary s5801 College

Chicago style pizza lovers based in San Francisco proper though the thing with Zachary s was it was across the Bay Which is like when Manhattanites complain about going to any other borough OMG It s so far Or if you grew up in Olathe Kansas like I did it was like having to go across town and traverse the three different sets of railroad tracks any of which might set you back 15 minutes waiting for a half mile long train to crawl by and if you were really unlucky you d get a train at all three But I digress Anyway SF deep dish lovers caught a break in 2005 when Little Star opened in Western Addition there s now a second location in the Mission It does deep dish proper not stuffed so there s no top layer But probably only Chicago natives and Windy City tourists will register the distinctions It also opts for a cornmeal crust As I said Ed Levine here in the office whom I m bugging as I m writing this all out said he liked Little Star s crust more It s buttery rich and crisp he says Of course he still says it s more a casserole than a pizza Again the waits at Little Star can be long my SF friends say Maybe as long as two hours on a Friday or Saturday And you can t do the order ahead thing like you can at Zachary s Oh and LS too does a thin crust pizza New York Style Arinell and Gioia and Pizza My Heart Photograph Nick Sherman of Pizza Rules There are a handful of places to get a New York style slice in the area Arinell Gioia and Pizza My Heart Arinell has been around for more than 30 years and is the granddaddy of New York style pizza in the area It s the place that I ve been recommended the by SF area friends and Slice rs when I put out requests for pizzerias to hit up on my visits to the region From what my peeps tell me it pretty much mirrors no frills NYC slice joints with just the standard toppings and what not If you re visiting SF and are doing destination pizzerias this might not be your place but if you re near one of its two locations and are jonesing for NYC style pizza it may be an option Arinell Pizza2119 Shattuck Avenue Berkeley CA 94704 510 841 4035509 Valencia Street San Francisco CA 94110 415 255 1303 Will Gioia Gioia s Pizzeria and his pizza Photographs Gioia Pizzeria It seems that every city of a certain size has a New York native who decided the area needed a New York style pizzeria Berkeley already had the aforementioned Arinell but that didn t stop Brooklyn native Will Gioia from opening his eponymous place in 2004 Our man Ed Levine here was impressed with Gioia when he visited The place is New York style but with a bit more upscale touch than say Arinell Seasonal toppings and a note about sustainably raised meat grace the menu which lists things like The Julian calabrese sausage with spicy winter greens red onions garlic and capers And hey the Formaggio pie with two types of mozzarella and grana padano sounds a bit Di Fara esque don t it Gioia Pizzeria 1586 Hopkins Street Berkeley CA

Heart And you can t walk around the Bay Area without seeing someone in a Pizza My Heart T shirt The mini chain with about 15 locations in the greater Bay started in the little coastal town of Capitola in 1981 They serve a decent approximation of New York style pizza in welcoming faux surf shop restaurants pizza is usually ordered by the slice and those slices are slid back into the gas oven before they re served This being California there s a whole lot of wacky topping going on some of which is just too much for me tomato and pesto sauce with tomatoes ricotta chicken sausage and artichoke The crust isn t thick enough to take it I prefer their simpler creations a slice with Roma tomatoes thinly shaved red onion California garlic and a sprinkle of basil was always my go to order The crust can be a little flat in taste and in rise but for an area without a real slice shop tradition it s pretty damn good Carey Jones Adam s Picks Thanks Carey I ll add PMH to my to try list next visit But right now I ll cover a few spots that for me have been tried and true I have a number of spots I always end up at when I visit the Bay Area and a number of places that are still on my to try list often because I can t seem to tear myself away from my tried and true faves Here I ll just blab some from each list Tried and True Emilia s Pizzeria Berkeley Photograph Adam Kuban I really like Emilia s Pizzeria in Berkeley which is doing a sort of New York Neapolitan or Neapolitan American style pizza I ve written about it a few times on Slice If you want to read more here First Look Some Great Pizza at Emilia s Pizzeria in Berkeley California I ll quote myself In this whole pizza moment we ve been experiencing lately it s all Neapolitan this and artisanal that Freilich though is not trying

more suited for take outSuch unpretentiousness is not to say that Freilich is unconcerned with the ingredients or the thought that go into the pizzas Though his menu is not yet set he s making his own Italian sausage applied in nice large loose chunks and sourcing cured meat toppings from San Francisco s Molinari Sons salumeria He won t say where the cheese is from but he s using a mixture of both

map emiliaspizzeria com Tried and True My Other Picks I was going to recommend a handful of other places but when I asked L A Pizza Maven for his picks and he turned them in it turned out we re pretty much in agreement Rather than parrot each other I ll just let him do the talking below Still I will point out Pizzaiolo Charlie Hallowell the pizza maker owner of this place in Oakland spent a number of years at Chez Panisse picking up the local sustainable really good food stuff He brings all that to the pizza here The cheese he uses on the Margherita is easily the best cheese I ve ever had on a Margherita pizza It s been a few months since I ve had a pizza here but I can still taste that cheese and feel its buttery smoothness Hallowell has since opened a sister pizzeria in Oakland called Boot and Shoe Service it s in the space of a former cobbler which if food critic Michael Bauer can be believed sounds as good as Pizzaiolo Boot and Shoe Service 3308 Grand Avenue Oakland CA 510 763 2668 bootandshoeservice com Pizzeria Delfina I ve just always had really good pizza here Neapolitan influenced but cooked in a gas fired oven Slice readers report that it can be pretty inconsistent but I ve always had a good pie there at the Mission District location The place benefits from the whole California ingredient driven menu Look for seasonal specials and interesting combinations of toppings Pizzeria Picco This is my absolute favorite of the wood fired oven places in the area Yeah it s not really Bay Area I guess since it s up a bit into Marin County north of the city and across the Golden Gate Bridge But if you re visiting SF and decide to cross the bridge and see the beautiful landscape up north you should stop in Larkspur A16 Here s the thing I think the A16 pizza is adequate It s not going to blow you away but it s much better than many of the Neapolitan VPN pizzas I ve had Still there s one little thing that I LOVE about A16 and that is the HOT CHILE OIL It s served in little jars on the tables and it elevates any pizza it s drizzled on My To Try List at the Top Pizza Hacker Pizza Hacker with his heavily modded FrankenWeber Photograph Eric Wolfinger There are a number of places in the Bay Area I still want to try At the top of my list however is a place that is not so much a place It s a dude A dude with a Weber kettle grill that he s converted into a portable wood fired pizza oven He calls it the Franken Weber He shows up on the street with it cooks pies and sells them Yes this is Pizza Hacker who you might have read about here before I have heard

the edge of Yosemite National Park prospectorwines com L A Pizza Maven s Take Because our man in L A gets himself to the Bay Area more than I do I asked L A Pizza Maven if he d chime in with his take on the Bay Area Northern California pizza scene Take it away LAPM The Mgmt Over the last 5 years or so the Bay Area north south east and west has blossomed like Death Valley after the recent drought ended When I lived in San Francisco and Berkeley during the 80s good pizza was a rare commodity Great pizza was as hard to find as a righteous man in Sodom Harder even But that s all changed And I m not ashamed to admit that I can t name an unqualified favorite Nevertheless I ll try to make some helpful distinctions starting with my favorites since that s probably what you re most interested in My Top 3 Bay Area Pizzerias Before I tear out the remaining hairs on my head I m going to call Pizzeria Picco in Larkspur Pizzaiolo in Oakland and Tony s Pizza Napoletana of North Beach in San Francisco tied in a photo finish for the region s best pizza I ll get to those in a bit but first let me build up to them Starting from the bottom up let s begin with Howie s Artisan Pizza Located in the upscale Town and Country outdoor mall in Palo Alto which is in the South Bay for nonlocals Howie s is helmed by longtime area chef and restaurateur Howard Bulka and has been open for roughly a year I stopped in here early one afternoon on the way up to San Francisco but only had time and stomach capacity to order one pie a sausage pizza The fennel sausage was house made from naturally raised Berkshire pork The pie left me smiling The ingredients all produced by small farmers most of them barely reaching a height of three and a half feet were fresh and carefully selected the crust baked in a brick lined gas oven at roughly 650 F was nicely charred and blistered Frankly I can t pinpoint what was lacking but somehow I wasn t overwhelmed This testifies to my absurdly neurotic standard though most Slice readers probably fall into that category By any sane measure Howie s is an excellent addition to the California pizza scene and perhaps a somewhat intangible point that some of us may appreciate Howie was there himself aproned and working on a new sourdough starter Howie s Artisan Pizza howiesartisanpizza com Gialina Pizzeria Photograph Adam Kuban Due north in San Francisco is Gialina s a cozy pizza place in the San Francisco s Glen Park neighborhood I ve eaten here twice the review is on Slice here and was impressed both times This is where I first encountered nettles on a pizza that is I ve sampled several pies here the Atomica the wild nettle pizza with pancetta red onions and aged provolone the sweet Italian sausage broccoli rabe and aged provolone pie and the potato with applewood smoked bacon onions and gorgonzola All these pizzas burst with flavors and imagination There are several tasty salads and antipasti including a pork belly dish that a native Chinese foodie sitting next time claimed was as good as the pork belly from the village he hailed from The ambiance at Gialina s is friendly and inviting and though it gets crowded they will take your name and give you a call so you can wait in a nearby bar or stroll around My only criticism of the pizza is that compared to the very best pizzas to be had the crust lacked somewhat in texture For my taste Gialina s crust was a bit too brittle lacking the chewy quality that the finest pizzaioli can coax out of the dough Still if anyone invited me to Gialina s I d jump Gialina 2842 Diamond Street San Francisco CA 94131 map 415 239 8500 gialina com Pizzeria Delfina Photograph Adam Kuban Another of the Bay Area s top pizza destinations is Pizzeria Delfina also reviewed here on Slice Delfina has its rabid followers guaranteeing a long wait for dinner but it is definitely worth it I ve dined at the original Mission District location and the newer Pacific Heights outpost and had thoroughly satisfying pies at each location The Margherita definitely exhibited the characteristic wet center of the true Neapolitan pizza style That may disappoint those unfamiliar with this increasingly common pizza interpretation On my next visit I added sausage to a Margherita and quickly devoured the spicy offering The ingredients were top quality and mostly locally sourced I believe The crust nicely charred and puffy particularly for a gas oven did not let down Again for no palpable reason I have to rate Pizzeria Delfina just below my very favorite Bay Area pies Pizzeria

Kuban Also in the city A16 the first VPN certified pizza maker in the Bay Area served me two mouthwatering pies The Margherita perhaps a bit too soupy for my taste still screamed Eat me The sausage pie lifted me up onto a pizza cloud Each bite yielded chunks of spicy fennel sausage and creamy mozzarella This elegant Italian restaurant proved a bit difficult to get into on a Friday night but it is open for lunch perhaps not everyday though A16 2355 Chestnut Street San Francisco CA 94123 415 771 2216 a16sf com Tony s Pizza Napoletana Photograph Adam Kuban I ve had the Margherita with sausage at Tony s and after the first bite I transformed into a type of two legged primate notably unconcerned with public dining civilities The crust achieved the magical crisp and chewy quality that distinguishes the very best pies from the merely very good The sausage pie was my only sampling of Tony s but that may have been because I was overwhelmed by the options Gemignani of Naples award winning fame offers pies in a dizzying number of styles baked in four different types of ovens TPN is open for lunch which sets it apart from most of these other restaurants Tony s Pizza Napoletana

to try it and now that he s set to open another pizza restaurant in San Francisco I m sure I ll take him up on that offer The Cannondale essentially a sausage pie and the heirloom tomato and pancetta pies stood out for me The crust however is what really elevates Picco s pizza to the top of my list Pizzeria Picco 316 Magnolia Avenue Larkspur CA 94939 415 945 8900 pizzeriapicco com Pizzaiolo The potato pancetta fontina and rosemary pizza from Pizzaiolo Photograph LAPM Lastly Pizzaiolo in Oakland merits inclusion at the very top o the pizza heap Like the other artisanal pizza makers here Charlie Hallowell has created a real jewel on this bourgeiosified stretch of Telegraph Avenue in the East Bay Locally sourced ingredients and a wood burning oven combine in properly trained hands to produce unsurpassed pizzas My favorites were the Margherita with sausage added and the potato pie Like Picco and Tony s the exceptional crust is the difference maker The perfect leopard spotting and the puffy blisters truly delivered an eye opening taste bud delirium What more can a pizza madman ask for Pizzaiolo 5008 Telegraph Avenue Oakland CA 94609 510 652 4888 pizzaiolooakland com So there it

butter The original recipe also calls for garnishing the frosting with 1 cup of toasted coconut flakes but I opted for a dusting of chocolate grated chocolate because I didn t want the coconut to overshadow the dulce de leche frosting Make sure to use coconut milk and not cream of coconut as the latter is much sweeter and thicker Coconut milk can be found in the international food section of most local grocery stores The consistency of the dulce de leche frosting will depend on how much or or how little you add of the dulce de leche sauce I ve written the recipe as 1 2 cup 1 cup to

msnbc.com college students think they're so special"",""body"":""NEW YORK Today s college students are more narcissistic and self centered than their predecessors according to a comprehensive new study by five psychologists who worry that the trend could be harmful to personal relationships and American society We need to stop endlessly repeating You re special and having children repeat that back said the study s lead author Professor Jean Twenge of San Diego State University Kids are self centered enough already Twenge and her colleagues in findings to be presented at a workshop Tuesday in San Diego on the generation gap examined the responses of 16 475 college students nationwide who completed an evaluation called the Narcissistic Personality Inventory between 1982 and 2006 The standardized inventory known as the NPI asks for responses to such statements as If I ruled the world it would be a better place I think I am a special person and I can live my life any way I want to The researchers describe their study as the largest ever of its type and say students NPI scores have risen steadily since the current test was introduced in 1982 By 2006 they said two thirds of the students had above average scores 30 percent more than in 1982 We re all above average Narcissism can have benefits said study co author W Keith Campbell of the University of Georgia suggesting it could be useful in meeting new people or auditioning on American Idol Unfortunately narcissism can also have very negative consequences for society including the breakdown of close relationships with others he said The study asserts that narcissists are more likely to have romantic relationships that are short lived at risk for infidelity lack emotional warmth and to exhibit game playing dishonesty and over controlling and violent behaviors Twenge the author of Generation Me Why Today s Young Americans Are More Confident Assertive Entitled and More Miserable Than Ever Before said narcissists tend to lack empathy react aggressively to criticism and favor self promotion over helping others The researchers traced the phenomenon back to what they called the self esteem movement that emerged in the 1980s asserting that the effort to build self confidence had gone too far I am special I am special As an example Twenge cited a song commonly sung to the tune of Frere Jacques in preschool I am special I am special Look at me Current technology fuels the increase in narcissism Twenge said By its very name MySpace encourages attention seeking as does YouTube Some analysts have commended today s young people for increased commitment to volunteer work But Twenge viewed even this phenomenon skeptically noting that many high schools require community service and many youths feel pressure to list such endeavors on college applications Campbell said the narcissism upsurge seemed so pronounced that he was unsure if there were obvious remedies Permissiveness seems to be a component he said A potential antidote would be more authoritative parenting Less indulgence might be called for The new report follows a study released by UCLA last month which found that nearly three quarters of the freshmen it surveyed thought it was important to be very well off financially That compared with 62 5 percent who said the same in 1980 and 42 percent in 1966 Yet students while acknowledging some legitimacy to such findings don t necessarily accept negative generalizations about their generation Hanady Kader a University of Washington senior said she worked unpaid last summer helping resettle refugees and considers many of her peers to be civic minded But she is dismayed by the competitiveness of some students who seem prematurely focused on career status We re encouraged a lot to be individuals and go out there and do what you want and nobody should stand in your way Kader said I can see goals and ambitions getting in the way of other things like relationships Kari Dalane a University of Vermont sophomore says most of her contemporaries are politically active and not overly self centered Enough about me what do you think about me People are worried about themselves but in the sense of where are they re going to find a place in the world she said People want to look their best have a good time but it doesn t mean they re not concerned about the rest of the world Besides some of the responses on the narcissism test might not be worrisome Dalane said It would be more depressing if people answered No I m not special 2011 The

BlogMarch 29 2011 Thomas Insel The purpose of science is not to open the door to an infinitude of wisdom but to set some limit to the infinitude of error Brecht GalileoThis quote comes to mind with a couple of recent clinical research reports that suggest some of the broadly accepted wisdom of our field may be wrong For instance lack of adherence to oral medication has been widely considered the most common reason for treatment failure in schizophrenia However in a recent random assignment study with a two year follow up an injectable long acting medication was no better than oral medication as measured by re hospitalization or quality of life measures In another example PTSD has been assumed to be a leading cause of the increased suicides in soldiers and veterans Yet a recent VA study of more than 7 000 suicides found that bipolar disorder was the most prevalent diagnosis PTSD only increased the risk for suicide when complicated by substance abuse Nonetheless windows to completely new areas of research have been opened recently by research efforts in basic science These reports may not offer an infinitude of wisdom but they force us to consider factors that have not previously been thought to have any role in mental health or illness For instance Rochellys Diaz Heijtz and colleagues have brought the microbiome to the study of brain and behavior Microbiomics is an emerging area of biomedical research characterizing the microbes of the human body Only about 10 of the DNA on our bodies is human with the other 90 belonging to a vast array of bacterial species many of which have only recently been identified Does this microbial ecology influence human health Several studies have implicated the microbial flora of the gut in obesity Some have wondered if the microbial environment could also affect brain development The Heijtz team provides some of the first evidence supporting this idea They compared the offspring of germ free mice to mice with normal gut bacteria Offspring of germ free mice had changes in neurotransmitters growth factors synaptic proteins and anxiety related behaviors relative to mice exposed to normal bacteria during development Germ free moms given the bacteria of the control mice had offspring with the behaviors of the control mice But germ free mice that were exposed to gut bacteria as adults never adopted the behavior patterns like the level of fearfulness of mice that are born and grow up in an environment with bacteria Apparently there is a sensitive period during fetal development when the mother s bacterial environment can influence brain development and subsequent behavior of her offspring The mechanism is unknown but there are clear implications for mental disorders Equally intriguing are recent findings from the field of epigenomics If genomics is the study of DNA as text epigenomics is the study of how this text is highlighted or redacted by proteins that bind to the DNA Epigenomics is one process by which environmental factors from stress to diet to toxins influence development in other words how nurture alters nature Uchida and colleagues compared two different strains of laboratory mice one that is highly susceptible to stress and another that is resistant They looked for epigenomic differences in the nucleus accumbens a region of the brain known to be involved in reward and according to some studies in the response to stress They found a difference in the GDNF gene the glial derived neurotrophic factor gene which had previously been implicated in the stress response The genomic sequence was identical in the two strains but in the stress susceptible mice epigenomic marks silenced GDNF leading to reductions in the amount of GDNF protein A chemical inhibitor of these epigenomic tags reversed the stress fear behavior of these mice Conversely when epigenomic silencing of GDNF was induced in the resilient mice they became fearful These kinds of basic studies on epigenomics begin to identify novel factors involved in individual responses to stress and they suggest a mechanism by which early experience nurture can have enduring effects on stress responsiveness nature Epigenomics may also identify clinical subgroups Gregory and colleagues reported a rare mutation in the oxytocin receptor gene in a single case of autism In many more people with autism they found this same gene to be silenced by epigenomic methylation Jacquemont and colleagues recently reported a sub group of patients with autism who benefit from a new drug to treat Fragile X Syndrome a genetic form of intellectual deficit often associated with autism While the medication had no effect in the over all group of 38 patients in a subgroup with the Fragile X gene completely shut off by an epigenomic tag there was significant improvement Whether epigenomics will be a useful biomarker for selecting treatments remains to be seen but these early studies suggest that genomics is giving us only part of the story of individual differences We are living through an extraordinary period of discovery in neuroscience analogous to the exuberant periods of theoretical physics a century ago or microbiology a half century ago The challenge is keeping up navigating between the infinitude of wisdom and the infinitude of error RA Rosenheck JH Krystal R Lew PG Barnett L Fiore D Valley SS Thwin JE Vertrees MH

cooks and bakers get ballsy in the kitchen at least we should be gettin ballsy sometimes the results are tremendous and other times disastrous As in life in the kitchen it s important to step out of your comfort zone take a leap of faith and just go for it For me my comfort zone is definitely in the cupcake cookie zone so when I snatched the amazing Baked New Frontiers In Baking and drooled after some big boy cakes I decided to step it up At first blush this cake is intimidating lots of steps which in my mind means lots of chances to muck things up The beauty of this cake the recipe is so well plotted and in depth that you ll never worry about what comes next My only gripe which can be a good thing the frosting and lemon curd yield much more than the cake requires I d recommend getting creative and using this is some other cake like product Real lemon curd is just amazing I d also recommend trimming the cake layers before assembling they ll just slide all over the place Also don t mess with them while they are cooling in their tins you ll just be asking for trouble All that being said the result Perfection I loved every bit of this cake and will make it again and again The lemon bits are subtle and zingy while the frosting is delicate and not overly sweet So get ballsy guys you ll be glad you did For the Lemon Drop Cake layers 2 1 2 c cake flour3 4 c all purpose flour1

extract1 2 c lemon curd Garnish mini lemon candies Make the Lemon Cake Layers Preheat oven to 325 degrees Butter 3 8 round cake pans line the bottoms with parchment and butter the parchment Dust with flour and knock out excess In the large bowl sift the flours baking powder baking soda and salt together Set aside In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment beat the butter and shortening on medium speed until creamy 3 to 4 minutes Add the sugar vanilla and lemon zest and beat on medium speed until fluffy about 3 minutes Scrape down the sides of the bowl add the egg and beat until just combined Reduce speed to low Add the flour mixture alternating with the ice water in three separate additions beginning and ending with the flour mixture Scrape down the bowl then mix on low speed for a few more seconds In a clean bowl whisk the egg whites and cream of tartar until soft peaks form Do not over beat Gently fold the egg whites into the batter Divide the batter among the prepared pans and smooth the tops Bake for 40 45 minutes rotating the pans halfway through baking time until a toothpick inserted in the center of each cake comes out clean Transfer the cakes to a wire rack and let cool for 20 minutes Invert the cakes onto the rack remove pans and let cool completely Remove the parchment Make the Lemon Curd Filling In a small bowl pour the lemon juice over the lemon zest and let stand for 10 minutes to soften the zest In a nonreactive bowl whisk the eggs egg yolks and sugar until combined Add the lemon zest and lemon juice to the mixture and whisk until just combined Place your bowl containing the egg mixture over a double boiler Continuously stir the mixture with a heatproof spatula until the mixture has thickened to a pudding like texture about 6 minutes Remove the bowl from the heat and whisk the butter until emulsified Strain the mixture through a fine mesh sieve Take a sheet of plastic wrap and press it into the mixture and around the bowl so that the curd does not form a skin Set the lemon curd aside while you are making the frosting Do not refrigerate the curd unless you re saving it for future use Make the Lemon Drop Frosting In a medium heavy bottomed saucepan whisk the sugar and flour together Add the milk and cream and cook over medium heat whisking occasionally until the mixture comes to a boil has thickened about 20 minutes Transfer the mixture to the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with a paddle attachment Beat on high speed until cool Reduce the speed to low and add the butter mix until thoroughly incorporated Increase the speed to medium high and beat until the frosting is light and fluffy Add the vanilla extract and 1 2 cup of the lemon curd and continue mixing until combined If the frosting is too soft put it in the refrigerator to chill it slightly then mix it again until it is the proper consistency If the frosting is too firm place the bowl over a pot of simmering water and beat with a wooden spoon until it is the proper consistency Assemble the Cake Refrigerate the frosting for a few minutes but no more until it can hold its shape Place one cake layer on a serving platter Trim the top to create a flat surface and evenly spread about one cup of the remaining lemon curd filling on top Add the next layer trim and fill with 1 cup of lemon curd then add the third layer and trim Crumb coat the cake and refrigerate for about 15 minutes Frost the sides and the top of the cake with the frosting Garnish with the candies and refrigerate for 15 minutes to firm up the finished cake This cake will keep beautifully in a cake saver at room temperature cool and humidity free for up to 3 days If your room is not cool place the cake in a cake saver refrigerate for up to 3 days Remove the cake

jocks as being awkward Usually being socially inept painfully poor with words or just supremely dopey is considered the work of the Dungeons and Dragons sect In reality though most people have their awkward moments some more than others And athletes are certainly no exception Sure there are plenty of professional athletes who are impossibly cool and never had an awkward day in their lives Dwyane Wade Derek Jeter and Tom Brady come to mind Talk about ridiculously unfair right However for every Derek Jeter there s an Alex Rodriguez Someone who never says the right thing and always manages to embarrass himself despite all the advantages his wealth and success afford him Let s take a look at 20 of the most awkward athletes in sports 20 Tim Thomas Boston Bruins There s nothing more awkward than mixing politics with anything besides politics One of the perks of winning a championship is that it comes with an invitation to meet the president at the White House In 2012 Bruins goaltender Tim Thomas didn t see the invitation as a perk of winning the Stanley Cup but rather the perfect time to make a political statement by first denying the invitation and issuing a lengthy public explanation And then there s that mustache 19 James Harrison Pittsburgh Steelers You probably don t usually think of scary gun brandishing tough guys as awkward but Steelers linebacker James Harrison sure knows how to make things uncomfortable on and off the field Harrison has a way of saying just the wrong thing Whether he s threatening the commissioner of the NFL and calling him the devil or making fun of the Patriots for losing in the Super Bowl he has a way of making things awkward I probably wouldn t tell him any of this to this face though 18 A j Pierzynski Chicago White Sox White Sox catcher A J Pierzynski is awkward in that way Ben Affleck s character Fred O Bannion was awkward in Dazed and Confused Sorry for the extremely specific reference but anyone who has seen the movie will know what I m talking about O Bannion was the loudest guy in any room the meanest guy in any room and the dumbest guy in any room And he was way too dumb to realize that everyone in the room hated him and nobody was laughing with him they were laughing at him There are few things in life more awkward than a d bag who thinks he s awesome Sound familiar A J 17 Rajon Rondo Boston Celtics It s no secret that Celtics superstar point guard Rajon Rondo is a bit of an odd duck An odd enough duck that a seriously aging Boston team was considering trading away one of the best players in the league just so it didn t have to deal with him Rondo has an interesting sense of fashion often an unpleasant and off putting demeanor with the media and he knows how to add a little flavor to the tip off of every game There really isn t anyone else like him in sports it may be a little awkward at times but it s definitely not a bad thing 16 Bode Miller Olympic Skier The Olympics represent the pinnacle of an elite athlete s career Few qualify and even fewer achieve glory So when one of the favorites to medal in the Winter Olympics talks about his preparation hopes and experience in the days before the 2006 games you d expect him to be aware of the honor the moment Well downhill skier Bode Miller had different ideas and predictably it was extremely awkward for him the media and his sponsors In multiple interviews he rambled about how little he cared about skiing skiing in the Winter Olympics and about how skiing drunk is not easy We don t care anymore either Bode and most of us never did Awwwwwkward 15 Brian Wilson San Francisco Giants Giants relief pitcher Brian Wilson is awkward because he wants to be awkward At some point in time he decided to ditch his frat boy persona and faux hawk in favor of a spandex tuxedo and lush beard Almost everything he does is deliciously awkward by design like this stone cold weirdo stare down of President Obama during the Giants post World Series visit to the White House Only Wilson could pull this kind of weirdness off without getting nicked by the fuzz 14 Ilya Bryzgalov Philadelphia Flyers First let s acknowledge that broken English especially broken English coming from a Russian hockey player is inherently awkward However Ilya Bryzgalov is included here based on merit The Flyers goalie has managed to combine a slightly shaky grasp on the English language with a cheerful enthusiasm for saying goofy things that have nothing to do with any language barrier His head scratching statements have inspired an Internet meme and he outdid himself in the 2012 NHL playoffs against the Penguins when he declared I m not afraid of anything I m only afraid of bear Bear in the forest 13 Mike Tyson Retired Boxer I m fairly certain Mike Tyson was created from an element called awkwardtonium Few sports are as conducive to awkward moments than boxing two dudes who are going to beat the living hell out of each other get placed in front of a mic early and often for the biggest matches However Tyson took this to another level bringing together physical intimidation bizarre behavior violence and pomp to produce a mega slurry of awkwardness Where do you begin Threatening to eat Lennox Lewis children The pigeon hobby The scary face tat The Robin Givens drama The best approach is just to click here assuming you can handle the awkwardness 12 Pau Gasol Los Angeles Lakers I really don t think Lakers big man Pau Gasol can help being awkward He s very likable and a super nice guy but when you re a goofy looking white dude who tops out at 7 good luck not being awkward Gasol s infamous head patting incident with Clippers superstar point guard Chris Paul is a great example There was no doubt Gasol s gesture wasn t done out of malice but everyone agreed that it was awkward and Paul had every right to come back at him for it Something tells me CP3 was willing to forgive and forget how could you stay mad at Pau That would be awkward 11 Nyjer Morgan Milwaukee Brewers There are so many different varieties of awkward Milwaukee s Nyjer Morgan is the crazy variety Morgan has been known to unleash on fans teammates and the media alike and it s always kind of a weird event It s difficult to even understand what Morgan s motivations intentions are because he often hides behind the guise of Tony Plush the misbehaving alter ego he created The most awkward thing here are the conversations his actions likely force with management I d hate to be charged with having the no swearing on television or no throwing garbage at fans conversation with Tony Plush for the umpteenth time 10 Peter Crouch Stoke City FC There s nothing that can make an already lanky and awkward man look more awkward than being on the arm of one of the most beautiful women in the world Although all things considered Stoke City s Peter Crouch is probably fine with that Gangly Crouch closed the ultimate is she really going out with him deal when he married stunning model Abbey Clancy in July 2011 I m sure they are madly in love and that Crouch has a really fantastic personality but man they are a beautiful one half of a couple However as that Meat Loaf song almost says one out of two ain t bad Shut up it s close enough 9 Joe Flacco Baltimore Ravens Considering that Trent Dilfer represents the high water mark for Ravens quarterbacks Joe Flacco was drafted by the team in 2008 with a lot to prove on and off the field Flacco has been solid but inconsistent on the field and has managed to squander most of his cache with some fair or not statements and decisions that didn t exactly ingratiate himself to the fans Hell it doesn t even seem like his teammates are on board most of the time Whether it s calling himself the best quarterback in the NFL or shred n on his skateboard a few days before the AFC championship Flacco s default has been set to awkward 8 Pete Rose Retired MLB Former Reds legend turned disgrace Pete Rose lives for those awkward moments in life First of all betting on baseball first as a player then as a manager doesn t get much more awkward than that Then there was lying about it Then there was telling the truth about it Then there was divorcing his wife of two decades and shacking up with skanky Playboy model Kiana Kim Then of course there was appearing on Howard Stern s radio show to talk about his sex life with the skanky Playboy model Ew ew ew ew ew ew ew ew 7 Floyd Mayweather Jr Boxing Floyd Mayweather Jr is a lot of things an undefeated boxer crazy rich strangely hostile about Manny Pacquiao a violent sociopath and very awkward Mayweather s unhinged tirades directed at Pacquiao have all been awkward head scratchers It was also super awkward when he and his bestie 50 Cent played a game a telephone with giant stacks of money on HBO s 24 7 However nothing was more awkward than showing up to his latest fight against a lesser opponent that nobody wants to see on the arm of tween sensation Justin Bieber I m a belieber myself a belieber that Floyd Mayweather Jr is a socially awkward weirdo 6 Patrick Marleau San Jose Sharks Marleau has had the kind of up and down NHL career that would make most players awkward inconsistent play and bad headlines including being stripped of your captaincy mean you never really have house money play with in interviews However he s turned it into an art form from his goofy roster photo to his painful rambling interactions with the media In fact Marleau has inspired a Tumblr that posts absurd entirely fictional facts that actually seem plausible Patrick Marleau s favorite part about going skiing is the chair lift Patrick Marleau wears swim trunks when he showers in the locker room Patrick Marleau s favorite president is Martin Van Buren 5 Eli Manning New York Giants Let me just say that two Super Bowls and a fairly successful appearance on Saturday Night Live have done a lot to help the reputation of Giants quarterback Eli Manning Two years ago I would have unquestionably put him at No 1 Which means barely cracking the top five was a pretty big victory Despite the major strides Eli just has a goofy awkward way about him and I don t think there s much he can do to change it He may not have the cool confidence of big brother Peyton but he s got double the Super Bowl rings 4 Metta World Peace Los Angeles Lakers The Lakers resident lunatic Metta World Peace is hands down the most awkward dude in the NBA In a league that is known for its cool customers with swagg MWP really stands out amongst the likes of Kobe Bryant Dwyane Wade Derek Rose and Chris Paul MWP often does the wrong thing and usually says the wrong thing but he always makes things a lot weirder than they need to be There s no greater example of this than the painfully awkward sexts he exchanged with a woman he met on Twitter in July 2011 Check out the full story on Deadspin sexting will never be the same 3 Phil Kessel Toronto Maple Leafs Generally complete awkwardness and ice skating don t really go together Toronto s Phil Kessel is without a doubt the exception to that rule Dude doesn t have a non awkward bone in his body Kessel s interviews are unwatchable his mannerisms are jerky and strange and when he s on camera he completely loses his marbles Check out this awkward moment at UFC 140 it s vintage Kessel I never thought it could be so difficult to just smile and wave 2 Alex Rodriguez New York Yankees Yankees slugger Alex Rodriguez really shouldn t be awkward He doesn t have any of your standard awkward attributes He s attractive athletic professional successful a hit with the ladies and crazy rich And yet he is Remember his Super Bowl spotlight being hand fed popcorn by then girlfriend Cameron Diaz Sure it was weird and awkward but the fact that he really went ballistic over the incident was much worse Everything he does seems kind of weird and awkward and nothing illustrates that like his ill conceived self loving photo shoot for Details 1 Randy Moss San Francisco 49ers Moody and combative wide receiver Randy Moss is the absolute king of awkward Moss never does the right thing never says the right thing and has never been one to bother with the insincere apologies He s had more painfully awkward press conferences over his career than I can even count Of course there was his final act in New England where he decided to take his contract woes public which got him shipped off to Minnesota And then naturally in Minnesota Moss carried on his proud tradition of making people uncomfortable Like when he proudly announced he would only be taking questions from himself Hmm that doesn t sound awkward at all does it rankings\/list, multiple sports, cool lists you don't normally think of jocks as being awkward.

after the loss of her husband STORY HIGHLIGHTS Tosca Reno champions a clean eating lifestyle Clean eating means avoiding all processed food It really is a lifestyle change Reno says Living healthy has helped her power through grief after her husband s death CNN Tosca Reno is defying the odds At 53 the author and fitness expert refuses to subscribe to the stereotypes that accompany her age Instead she is changing them And in the process she s encouraging others to change their lives Reno the author of 13 clean eating books says the secret to being healthy and happy is eating clean Her popular Eat Clean Diet encourages individuals to drink plenty of water and eat six small meals daily including a combination of lean protein and complex carbohydrates Put simply clean eating is avoiding all processed food relying on fresh fruits vegetables and whole grains rather than prepackaged or fast food It may sound counterintuitive but eating clean allows you to eat more and weigh less because you are making smart food choices Reno said I sometimes get criticized for using the word diet but the Eat Clean Diet really is a lifestyle change that leads to healthy steady weight loss and healthy eating for life Reno s advice to those wanting to change their lives is to first realize there is another way to live This could come in the form of that a ha moment when you suddenly catch a glimpse of your lumpy reflection in a store window or perhaps after you receive some bad news at the doctor s office she said You just need that opening that moment when you finally decide to give yourself permission to change Reno s own a ha moment came at 40 Unhealthy and in an unhappy marriage she realized she must make changes After divorcing her first husband she began to see life differently That was when I began seeing the world as having possibilities instead of limitations she said Processed food linked to lower kids IQs At the time Reno was overweight and was battling heart problems and hypoglycemia She began going to the gym and decided to go back to school where she met fitness guru Robert Kennedy whom she later married I didn t know who he was but he said Listen I can get you into shape I soon learned who Robert was an icon she said Kennedy recipient of the 2012 Arnold Sports Festival Lifetime Achievement Award became highly regarded in the fitness industry after founding Robert Kennedy Publishing which has published 53 books and produces six fitness magazines Kennedy taught Reno how to eat healthily and work out and Reno began seeing results My physique changed Everyone started asking questions I felt l was owning a secret that it is 80 nutrition 10 training and 10 genetics Reno revealed her healthy secrets in her first book The Eat Clean Diet Since then she has developed a large following of readers However all the success in the world could not have prepared Reno for this past spring when she lost Kennedy her biggest champion to lung cancer She said eating clean has helped her manage her grief and maintain her strength I have abundant energy My emotional energy is strong she said I feel like when you have the nutritional army at work inside of you you are that much more able to ward off depression Reno said she is determined to make her late husband proud In addition to taking the reins at Robert Kennedy Publishing she will compete in a figure competition October 13 in his honor In the competition Reno will be judged on leanness muscularity muscle symmetry evidence of athleticism poise grace and confidence She said her late husband is providing her with all the confidence she needs His teachings are guiding me through this she said Each day Reno goes to the gym which she calls her drug of choice and does reps for Bob I m rebuilding myself she said Reno advises all who begin the Eat Clean Diet have a clear purpose in mind to power them through the process Anything new is challenging or different she said But it becomes second nature very quickly She advises dieters to envision the end result just like one would envision arriving at a travel destination I think you have to have your mind set in place she said What does the end result look like Doctors write a prescription for fresh produce Once a goal is determined Reno said individuals must prepare their surroundings to support that goal Clear your cupboards of all junk foods and then start planning healthy meals and shopping for clean food she said Reno s books contain meal plans grocery lists recipes and motivational tips to help Always having clean food available is key Reno said When you re cooking dinner double the recipe and pack the extra food for the next day s meals I call these planned leftovers she said This will make it super easy to just grab a healthy meal when you re pressed for time Also when you leave the house make sure you take a cooler filled with your healthy meals for the day Reno suggests setting weekly and monthly goals and writing them down People who write down their goals are 50 more likely to succeed Whether easing into the Eat Clean Diet or diving head first into it Reno said it s important for dieters to be committed to the process You re never going to get to your goals unless you re willing to do what you need to do to get there she said The most important way to achieve those goals is to manage time properly Reno said Plan your meals and training sessions for the week and try to delegate chores whenever possible Once you get into a routine you ll realize that the whole process is not as hard

"http://tipnut.com/rose-hips/"	"6265"	"{""title"":""Tips Recipes TipNut com "",""body"":""Wild rose hips are a very rich source of Vitamin C and are free for the picking Three average hips have as much Vitamin C as a medium sized orange Rose HipHarvesting Pick only the ripe berries that are vivid red and slightly soft They have a much better flavor if picked after the first frost preferably late August September or October You can harvest them from your garden but they re more plentiful from old time shrub varieties such as rugosas and wild rose bushes What Are They They are the fruit of the rose plant and are filled with tiny seeds and covered with silky hairs The food value is found in their skin and their taste is similar to that of an apple To encourage your roses to develop them don t trim the blossoms and leave them to naturally fade and fall Uses They can be used fresh in making jelly jam pickles juice etc or they can be dried or canned to be used in the winter or served raw shredded or halved in salads sandwich fillings and desserts When dried they are also a favorite in teas and homemade potpourri Important Before using as a food source make sure the plant you re harvesting from has not been treated with pesticides or chemicals How To Dry ThemDriedCollect quantities to be dried or made into teas jellies juice pickles etc for winter use The process is very easy and similar to air drying flowers follow these directions Sort out the imperfect ones and rinse the batch Carefully pat dry Line a cookie sheet with a screen or a sheet of cardboard or parchment or wax paper and spread them across in a single layer Leave in a dark well ventilated area for a few weeks they ll be ready when they are hard wrinkly and darker in color You can also do this in the oven on the lowest setting or use a dehydrator You can dry them whole or you can cut and seed first directions below If mainly using for teas leaving whole is fine Tips To remove the hairs from them once they ve dried grind them up a bit in the food processor then shake the batch in a sieve the hairs will fall loose After they have dried stems and ends can be removed easily by plucking them off Storage Seal in airtight containers or glass jars store away from direct light TeaThere is some loss of Vitamin C if there is a lengthy delay between picking and bottling the product although one of their important advantages as a source of Vitamin C is the unusual stability of this Vitamin as compared with other Vitamin C foods Tip Avoid using aluminum cookware and utensils when preparing them as it can deteriorate their Vitamin C content How To Make Tea When Using Fresh 1 to 2 TBS per cup of boiling water steep for 10 minutes When Using Dried 2 tsp per cup of boiling water steep for 10 to 15 minutes Tip Don t throw them out once they ve been used to make tea eat them after you re done drinking the tea or add to soups or serve as a side at the supper table They still have a lot of nutritional value even after they ve been used in teas Wild Roseberry Jam Gather the berries after the first frost Remove seeds and hull Wash Add water just barely to cover the berries Cook berries until soft If mixture is too thick add water as needed Set aside to cool Mash and put through sieve To 2 cups puree add 1 cup sugar and cook slowly until thick stirring frequently A better consistency is obtained if commercial pectin is used Pour into sterilized jars and seal The jam may be used on bread and as a filling for cakes Note If desired lemon juice may be added and used either as jam or meat sauce Roseberry Catsup 4 quarts ripe berries red and ripe 1 clove garlic2 medium sized onions1 cup water or more if necessary Boil these ingredients until they are soft Strain them Add 3 4 cup of brown sugar Tie in a bag and add 1 2 TBS whole allspice1 2 TBS mace1 2 TBS whole cloves1 2 TBS celery seed2 inch stick cinnamonBoil these ingredients quickly Add 1 cup vinegar cayenne salt if desired Boil catsup 10 minutes longer Bottle it at once Seal the bottles with wax The flavor of this catsup is excellent Roseberry Crabapple Jelly Use 1 2 crabapple juice and 1 2 rose hip puree To one cup of this mixture use 3 4 cup sugar This jelly retains its Vitamin C content for as long as nine months without loss Note The puree may be combined in jelly or jam with fruit such as cranberry grape chokecherry red currant wild plum etc Combine one part rose hip to two parts fruit or one to three if taste of rose hip is not desired A little acid such as lemon juice adds to the flavor as does honey used for part or all of sugar Most products will be softer at first but will stiffen on standing Do not place in sun to stiffen as this destroys Vitamin C How To Remove Hairs SeedsIt is desirable that the hairs and seeds be removed before consuming The fine hairs associated with the seeds are unpleasant in the mouth and have an irritating action A few different methods are used try one of the following Cut in half and shake out seeds this takes the longest time Cover with water and simmer then rub through a sieve using the puree Simmer whole Rose Hips in more than enough water to cover then merely strain Bottle the juice Add sugar if desired and process 45 mins This juice contains Vitamin C and may be added to sauces soups not cream soup puddings beverages and many other foods Did You Know Women and children were encouraged to gather them during World War II when food supplies were low the Vitamin C they provided were a much needed source of nutrition and was highly valued over the winter months Source Much of the information was found in Home Canning Guide Dominion Glass Co Limited vintage booklet Receive Updates From Tipnut Right To Your Inbox

volleyball I was an editor in journalism class I took all the AP classes I stressed out over Algebra and my hair was cut awkwardly short Like really bad I also didn t have a boyfriend I didn t even have the prospect of a boyfriend I had to ask out my dude prom date I dunno I had some of the best friends ever I wasn t really worried about too many things I feel like a good amount of high school girls read my blog I know this because most of them write me emails asking how to get through high school Usually the only answers I have for them include trying out for volleyball and journalism and cutting their hair awkwardly short That s really the only experience I have and I really shouldn t push that on strangers It s rude and damaging I recently received a question from a dear and darling high school senior in Chicago She called into the Homefries voicemail to ask us a question She didn t have a Chicago accent I was listening The questions boils down to this I m in high school I m a senior I ve liked this dude since my freshman year We ve texted a few times I think he likes me I just don t know if I should keep pursuing this guy because we re never going to see each other again once I go to college My answer is this You ve liked the same dude since freshman year Dang It s too bad dudes in high school don t know how to act I m 30 and most dudes my age don t know how to act Here s the deal You can sneak this dude behind the bungalows to make out with him but don t do more than that Mom I didn t do any of this Seriously That s not even a lie to spare you feelings Mostly you just have to wait for this dude to grow up That will probably take a while Sorry high school is so awkward and confusing We ve all been there except without the text messaging confusion Make out or don t but don t make it too complicated In short go to college don t sleep around learn how to be an awesome and independent woman No biggie Oh Also learn how to make an awesome cheesecake and feel good about your life Cheesecake is LONG overdue on this blog It s because I m not a huge fan of cheesecake I m not a huge fan of cheesecake because I don t own a spring form pan Cheesecakes always felt out of reach because of equipment alone Let s start this cheesecake with gingersnap crust Butter Sugar A pinch of salt and fluff Crispy store bought Gingersnap Cookies I love this crust because it so simply pressed into the pie plate and baked until golden Cheesecake filling is an incredible mixture of cream cheese eggs and sugar Cream too Adding a touch of lemon zest is dreamy also I want to swim in here I really really do You ll lick the beaters I did Lay off We ll top the creamy cheesecake with an almost bitter salted caramel It s sweet and full of depth and it all starts with butter and sugar Caramel is so easy to make There s no need for a candy thermometer All you need is the courage enough to boil sugar and water until it browns It you have the balls to do that you re on the sweet sweet road to caramel Here s the trick with caramel Remove the pan from heat just as it starts to brown The bottom of the pan will retain heat and continue to cook the caramel If you need it slightly more brown you can always return it to the heat You ve got the control Take it totally easy Once cooked and cooled pour caramel over cooled cheesecake Cool the topped cheesecake with cool caramel Do you see what s happening here Are you freaking out I am No bigs Cat wants too ps As soon as I have a kid I ll stop posting annoying cat pictures Promise but my fingers are crossed behind my back Salted Caramel Cheesecake Pie makes one 9 inch pie adapted from Dorie Greenspan and Zoe Nathan Print this Recipe For the Crust 2 cups ginger snap cookie crumbs 2 tablespoons brown sugar pinch of salt 1 2 stick 4 tablespoons unsalted butter melted For the Cheesecake 1 pound 2 blocks cream cheese at room temperature 1 1 3 cups granulated sugar 1 2 teaspoon salt 2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract 2 large eggs at room temperature 1 2 cup plus 2 tablespoons heavy cream 1 teaspoon lemon zest optional For the Caramel 1 2 cup granulated sugar 2 tablespoons water 2 tablespoons light corn syrup 1 3 cup heavy cream 2 tablespoons unsalted butter 1 2 teaspoon sea salt Place two rack in the upper and bottom third of the oven Preheat oven to 350 degrees F You ll need a 9 inch pie plate and a 9 13 inch pan for boiling water To make the crust place cookies in the bowl of a food processor and grind to a fine crumb If you don t have a food processor you can crumble cookies in a zip lock bag with a rolling pin Once you ve created a fine crumb add brown sugar salt and butter Toss together moistening all of the ginger snap crumbs Pour the mixture into a 9 inch pie plate and press with fingers until sides and bottom are evenly coated with crust Bake for 10 to 15 minutes until golden brown Remove from the oven and allow to cool while you make the cheesecake filling Reduce the oven temperature to 325 degrees F Place a tea kettle of water on the stove top to boil We re going to add hot water to the 9 13 inch pan to place under the baking cheesecake To make the cheesecake filling In the bowl of an electric stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment beat together cream cheese and granulated sugar Beat until light and fluffy about 3 to 5 minutes Beat in salt and vanilla extract until well incorporated Add eggs beating one at a time between each addition Once creamy and smooth slowly beat in the cream beating on medium high until creamy and luscious Add lemon zest if using Pour cheesecake mixture into the prepared cheesecake crust Place 9 13 inch pan in the bottom shelf of the hot oven Carefully pout in hot water and fill to 1 2 full Push into oven Place cheesecake on the upper oven shelf Bake for 50 to 60 minutes until cheesecake is browned and puffed When cheesecake is puffed and doesn t have loose giggle in the center turn oven off and use a towel to prop the oven open slightly Let cheesecake rest for another 45 minutes in the cooling oven Remove from the oven and cool completely for at least 4 hours Overnight is best While the cheesecake cools make the caramel so it can cool as well To make the caramel add sugar water and corn syrup to a medium saucepan Bring to a boil over medium heat stirring once or twice Bring to a boil and allow to brown Once sugar has browned to a medium amber color remove from heat and immediately add heavy cream and butter Mixture will boil and foam Stir well Add salt and stir well to incorporate Caramel may seem thin that s ok Place in a bowl Cover with plastic wrap and cool in the fridge for at least 4 hours overnight is best Pour the cooled caramel over the cooled cheesecake return to the refrigerator until ready to serve Sprinkle with a dash of sea salt then slice and serve Cheese will last for up to 4 days well wrapped in the refrigerator I am experimenting using Facebook comments on the site You can

family dinners there s also that need to be thankful for something may it be an occurrence through the passing year or just anything great in your life When you re a sports fan you know what you should be thankful for Your sporting idols your heroes People who made you stay up in the middle of the night so you can watch them play on different continents For Usain Bolt and Michael Phelps making the 2008 Olympics so special so memorable For making athletics and swimming cooler talk worthy For Michael Jordan making the argument of Greatest of All Time seem unnecessary For Roger Federer for being perfect and then being anything but For Ronaldinho bringing the fan back in soccer And Barry Sanders for making us still remember when the Detroit Lions mattered Roger Federer For perfect tennis between 2004 2007 when no one was even close to him excepts when he faced Rafael Nadal on the clay courts of Paris Elegance ice cool a shot of arrogance and domination the sport was missing after Pete Sampras just in a more versatile manner Yes having a dominant figure with just the right amount of flaws is essential for a sport like Tennis to thrive Thrown in an arch rival absolutely perfect Throw in shades of humanity of fragility Twice crying after an Australian Open final once after winning and once after losing an epic marathon to Rafael Nadal For his comeback after the decline began to win Grand Slam 14 15 and 16 Even on the clay courts of Paris For still giving his best at 30 Old for a tennis player even for a legend Ronaldinho Image Source Greece winning the 2004 Euro with their anti football turned the tide towards a return of classic beautiful football Just like after the 1990 World Cup in Italy which disgusted so many Cruyff s Barcelona dream team rose after that tournament just like Rijkaard s Barcelona which evolved into Pep Guardiola s Barcelona rose in 2004 All around Ronaldinho who came from Paris and needed a few months to start showing his magic consistently A new trick every match Even better He won with flair flash and wowing the fans not just Barcelona fans The 3 0 win at the Bernabeu over Real Madrid was his own private concert He won t be remembered as the greatest ever His reign and dominance were too short But Ronaldinho might win most exciting player ever Barry Sanders I didn t understand the NFL the way I do know back when Barry Sanders was slicing through fallen defensive players on his way to the end zone I did know that I m watching a special players Over a decade since he retired leaving the Detroit Lions to an era of misery I can say that he s the best running back I ve ever seen With a mediocre offensive line you usually don t get very far Not as a running back and not as a quarterback But Barry Sanders was just too good One of the few Heisman Trophy winners that live up to the hype Ten straight seasons of over 1000 yards and one incredible 1997 season in which he averaged 6 1 yards a carry Always knowing where the hole was always able to find an extra gear and extra step an extra move A special running back transcendent over his peers Likely not to be repeated Usain Bolt The great thing about athletics is the simplicity Just running Who s fastest and it s as simple as that Usain Bolt took the sprint into another stratosphere in terms of achievements and popularity The smile the swagger and the speed Slowing down in the Beijing Olympics and still destroying the 100 meter record The pose The fun It s rare to see someone so comfortable on the biggest stage so unmoved by the pressure and magnitude of the events I m not sure he ll ever get to break his own records if anyone will in the near future But Bolt made watching the 2008 Olympics and the IAAF championships the next summer something special something to look forward to a rarity these days with something as simple as running Michael Jordan A popular internet Meme is the 90 s Kid one with it s many variations talking about how good it was how better it is than now growing up in the 1990 s Well one of the constant bashing points is having Michael Jordan as your idol He might not be popular today especially among players but after the 1993 NBA Finals a reporter actually asked him if he is god He took over the sport twice taking a baseball retirement in between It s hard to describe through youtube videos and ESPN Classics to people who weren t old enough to watch basketball games between 1991 1998 That feeling of dread flowing through the Chicago Bulls rivals when Jordan took over in fourth quarters He didn t always make the last shot as he famously said in one of his commercials But there was never a situation in which you felt Jordan wasn t going to win it all by himself And he usually did Michael Phelps For the anticipation of the 2008 Olympics Michael Phelps went for it all in Athens 4 years earlier but finished with only six gold medals to the joy of Mark Spitz Four years later and nothing was stopping him If you believe in fate higher powers whatever there was something in the Chinese air and water The Jason Lezak final 50 meters The incredible controversial Milorad Cavic moment The 2008 Olympics belong to two men Usain Bolt and Michael Phelps For a swimmer to show such supremacy in every race through a torture like schedule he took on himself and to come out of that summer as the biggest star of the Summer Olympic Games sportige for usain bolt and michael phelps making the 2008 olympics so special, so memorable. for making athletics and swimming cooler-talk worthy. for michael jordan making the argument of greatest of all-time seem unnecessary. for roger federer, for being perfect and then being anything but. for ronaldinho, bringing the fan back in soccer. and

am I going to wear today This question is never more important than the day of a job interview Yes yes it s your personality and skills that really matter but your appearance is often what your interviewer will notice first and it can go a long way in showing her that you re ambitious professional and most importantly a great fit for the company Which means there s no one suit fits all approach for what to wear From your jacket to your shoes to even your accessories you ll want to consider the culture of the place you re applying before you pick out your ensemble So before you start shopping check out our guide to four common company types and what to wear for each Corporate Classics For companies that have a business or business casual dress code keep your look basic and conservative for the first interview Stick to these guidelines for the second and third interview too if it s a more formal organization The rule still applies that you dress for the job you want not the job you have or are applying for says etiquette expert Diane Gottsman check out her Job Interview Attire Quiz She recommends wearing a conservative suit a jacket with pants or a skirt in dark grey or navy and carrying a briefcase or purse not both Finish the look off with basic black pumps and simple elegant jewelry Business Casual Interview Style Depending on where you re interviewing on second interviews you may have an opportunity to dress down to some degree says Gottsman Unless the company s employees wear suits every day you can skip the jacket after the first interview or wear a more casual one just make sure you re still dressed a couple of notches above everyone else Remember that this is still the first time some of these people will see you she adds Think what you d normally wear to work dressed up a bit Diane Davis a New York based web editor recommends a dark skirt crisp white blouse statement necklace good bag and polished boots or pumps as weather appropriate A shift dress with a cardigan or blazer would also work well Start up Style If you re interviewing at a place where everyone comes to work in jeans and flannels you don t want to show up in a black suit it will signal that you won t fit in or don t understand the company culture Think about it they re running a ping pong in the break room style start up to avoid being around all those suits all day But that doesn t mean you should channel your inner hipster either It means wearing something you are comfortable in something that s work appropriate and something that represents you says Lauren Batty a start up recruiter at Connery Consulting LLC If I were interviewing in the start up world today I d wear a nice pair of dark jeans a simple shirt or sweater ballet flats and a small bag with enough room for a note pad pen and extra resumes A casual dress would be appropriate as well The Interviewer Wears Prada If you re gunning for a fashion industry job where the employees look more like Gucci models than Gap outfitted cubicle dwellers you re going to have to dress the part Dressing too stuffy boring or corporate will immediately indicate you re not the right fit before anyone even sits down to interview you says style expert Jennifer Chan To still look polished and professional pair one business like piece a pencil skirt a smart blazer or sleek trouser pants with something more fun a chic blouse and a great belt for example She also recommends wearing one but only one fabulous statement piece like patent pumps a collar necklace or a bold watch Above all you want target your look to the job you re applying for just like you target your resume and your answers to questions in the interview Having a killer look might not get you the job but it ll make sure you stay in the running Good luck Photo courtesy of Lauren Indvik and Polyvore Related posts when it comes to interview attire, there\u2019s no one-suit-fits-all approach. check out our guide to four common company

food a person eats during a day is mainly responsible for the amount of energy that person has available for the daily actions For a regular person with a regular job a normal and not very exhausting activity span a healthy diet is something very recommendable Such a diet usually contains a combination of approximated 40 fibers 30 proteins 10 water and natural juice or substitutes and only 20 carbohydrates What happens when a person has a job that requires a high amount of energy consumption The world is full of people that seem to go from one day to another permanently exhausted and without energy Most of the time we hear about this people that they just don t get enough sleep The sleep deprivation is a common cause for the permanent fatigue and also for a constant nervous disposition Can sleep be the only responsible for the increased number of tired people that we see all around us daily Usually under a huge amount of stress people tend to gain weight and the cause for this is not only an unhealthy diet When the work piles up and a 24 hr day seems to be insufficient to get the work done we tend to eat a lot of junk food and drink as many energy drinks as we can get our hands on in order to be able to stand and finish the tasks we are given The result is of a short term and comes with the side effect of addiction along with the weight gain everyone dreads So since we all need to get the energy somehow but in the mean time we need to keep out body machine functioning properly let s analyze which are the most energizing foods and drinks that can help us on our way to be the best we can be and also live a healthy and productive life 1 Green vegetables These little wonders of nature hide under their vivid green skin the entire complex of B vitamins as well as magnesium and iron These vitamins and minerals can be found in all green vegetables the leaders being broccoli asparagus and spinach Broccoli is an excellent resource of Q10 coenzyme the most important regenerative factor for the cellular activity The lettuce and cabbage are rich in vitamin C and the carotenes responsible for maintaining the quality of our vision as we grow old The so popular green vegetable salad is not just a Hollywood myth initiated by the gurus of let s get slim fast theory The constant intake of green vegetable in a raw or steamed form guarantees a high amount of healthy energy 2 Whole Cereals The most advertised means of a energizing breakfast the whole cereals are responsible for an energetic start of the day The carbohydrates and sugar in them is released gradually during digestion and that is how these smart drops from the nature s energy boost can help a person stay sharp and still be responsible with their diet The cereals are also an important source of B vitamins and are responsible for a good functioning of the spleen the body s energy battery 3 Green parsley These magical green leaves that seem so benign when considering the nutrition factor are a vitamin C bomb The green parsley leaves have more vitamin C than the citrus fruit As unbelievable as it may seem introducing them in a person s diet boosts up the level of cell regeneration and helps the body get more energy 4 Fruits It is common knowledge that fruits are a food group that guarantees an energy intake due to the fructose level and the vitamins they all carry The most energizing fruit are grapes peaches and citrus fruit dew to their high fructose content The most fruits have a large content of vitamins predominant C and through it a large energetic potential Of course the fruits can be replaced by fruit juice under the condition this is home made not bought from the supermarket Of course the bottled juice gives energy but because of the sugar addition after the sugar rush it produces the energy disappears very fast 5 Seeds Most of the seeds such as sunflower and pumpkin are very rich in proteins and minerals and their presence in a person s nutrition is an important source of energy These little seeds are also a source of magnesium and iron The polyunsaturated fats they contain are benefit for the cardiovascular system and help the blood flow to the heart and brain 6 Nuts All nuts from peanuts to pistachio are an excellent source of minerals with a high nutrition factor They contain vitamins A B and E potassium calcium magnesium phosphorus and iron They fight against anemia and bring the body durable energy 7 Fruit smoothies and shakes The smart combination of fruit juice and milk is always a source of energy The combination of vitamins and calcium increases the body s energetic potential and it is also a very refreshing helping hand when you get extra tired while working 8 Green tea The ancient source of energy that comes from the Asian countries has conquered the occidental shores creating a rave of fashion This green elixir is a source of antioxidants and an important resource of energy for the entire body During the last years it became quite a trend and has been made popular all over the web and media Apart from this trendy movement the green tea remains one of the top nutrition elements in providing energy 9 Honey The sweetness of the world honey maybe the most popular food ever since the concept of healthy became an issue in the nutritionist s conversation The best energetic content in a food item is the one provided by honey Used as a sweetener for tea and coffee or other hot drinks or simply consumed as it is it becomes an energy pill that helps the body regenerate and be more alert Recently the honey was introduced in packed cereals in power bars and in a large variety of energy drinks 10 Coffee It is only natural that the brain s alarm clock should be on top of the nutrition energy providers Coffee is known to boost up the attention increase the brain activity and improve the disposition It s pretty much our own adrenalin shot available in a hot steaming cup Whether we are young or old we all need a drop of energy to take us through a difficult or a busy day The way we watch over our diet can become an important step in providing our body the energy it needs Related

or a rushed meal to push you toward grabbing the quick fix Do a quick search through your house cabinets refrigerator under your pillow and so on and get rid of unhealthy snack food If your spouse

weight off is maintaining an active lifestyle It sounds ridiculous but research has shown that people tend to become more active when they have a pet Letting your dog take you for a walk at night will get you off the couch and keep your hand out of the junk food that you should have thrown out already No 7 Eat breakfastYour metabolism plummets while you sleep you go into a state of catabolism read breakdown The best way to jump start your metabolism and give your body the fuel it needs for the day to come is to eat a quality breakfast At a bare minimum your breakfast should have at least one serving of fruits and vegetables a lean protein source and a glass of water You can also add a quality whole grain carbohydrate source such as steel cut oats to your breakfast No 6 Avoid sugars pasta and white breadWhen you take in a whole grain carbohydrate source it takes time for your body to break down the food As a result you receive a slow consistent supply of food similar to a time release drug On the other hand foods like pasta white bread or anything high in sugar are rapidly digested and give your body a quick supply of a ton of energy Since your body doesn t need all of this energy at once it defaults to storing it as fat Overall these foods have little nutritional value and generally lead to metabolic damage and fat storage No 5 Learn how to cookShort term diet interventions never work long term In order to keep weight off you need to change your lifestyle to make it conducive to keeping weight off This sounds simple but for some men it can be a rough transition If you associate healthy eating with bland foods you probably won t continue to eat healthily for too long Learning how to use spices and prepare foods in different ways that you enjoy will help ensure that you re eating the right foods for the rest of your life You can start by perusing the grocery store for prepackaged spices like Cajun Italian seasoning Montreal steak and or chicken and seasoned salt Eating healthily does not need to be boring No 4 Lift weightsMuscle has a significantly higher metabolic rate than bone and fat Simply put this means that it takes more energy read calories to fuel muscle than it does other tissues within the body By lifting weights and adding some muscle mass you keep your metabolism and the number of calories you burn at rest high This is one of the most overlooked aspects of a quality fat loss program and is essential as part of a weight loss maintenance program No 3 Eat every 2 to 3 hoursOne of the best things you can do to keep weight off is to set up an eating schedule and stick to it Eating regularly tells your body that you are going to supply it with a consistent supply of quality nutrients and that it doesn t need to hoard anything It will also ensure that you don t binge eat because you re starving Figure out when you usually wake up in the morning and when you go to bed at night then plan meals every two to three hours in between Remember that keeping weight off is about keeping your metabolism high Skipping meals lowers your metabolism too so stick to your schedule No 2 Allow yourself cheat mealsSticking with the idea that keeping weight off needs to be a lifestyle change it s important that you don t deprive yourself of everything you like Eating healthily doesn t mean you can t ever have foods like burgers ice cream and pizza In fact when most people start a diet like that they fall off the wagon within the first month overcompensate by eating a ton of the foods they tried to cut out of their diet and end up gaining weight The solution is to allow yourself to eat cheat meals as 10 of your meals If you eat every two to three hours you ll eat around six meals per day Six meals per day times seven days per week is 42 meals per week This means that about four of your meals throughout the week can be cheat meals The key to a successful cheat meal is to eat something you enjoy but do not overeat In other

pig Like the Texas sky the options are endless 35 Chili crab Singapore You can t visit Singapore without trying its spicy sloppy meaty specialty While there are dozens of ways to prepare crab with black pepper salted egg yolk cheese baked et cetera chili crab remains the local bestseller Spicy chili tomato gravy tends to splatter which is why you need to mop everything up with mini mantou buns

on the kid s broccoli and see what happens makes just about anything worth trying Pass the cardboard please 33 Fish n chips Britain Anything that s been around since the 1860s can t be doing much wrong The staple of the Victorian British working class is a crunchy outside soft inside dish of simple un adorned food fundamentals Sprinkled with salt vinegar and dollops of tartar sauce it is to nouveau cuisine what Meat Loaf is to Prince or whatever he s calling himself now 32 Ankimo Japan So who s up for a chunk of monkfish liver with a little grated daikon on the side Thought not still you re missing out on one of sushi s last great secrets the prized ankimo The monkfish anglerfish that unknowingly bestows its liver upon upscale sushi fans is threatened by commercial fishing nets damaging its sea floor habitat so it s possible ankimo won t be around for much longer If you do stumble across the creamy yet oddly light delicacy anytime soon consider a taste you won t regret it 31 Parma ham Italy You see it folded around melon wrapped around grissini placed over pizza heaped over salad There s good reason for that these salty paper thin slices of air dried ham lift the taste of

"http://www.whowhatwear.com/website/full-article/look-we-love-1940s/"	"1679"	"{""title"":""Look We Love 1940s Celebrity Style and Fashion from WhoWhatWear "",""body"":""Friday September 30 2011 Whether it was the introduction of Dior s new look or the decade s beautiful leading ladies including Ava Gardner Rita Hayworth and Katharine Hepburn you have to admit there s something so incredibly elegant and timeless about 1940s fashion Admittedly we re suckers for this romantic era and as such were delighted to find a full blown redux of the 40s on the F W 11 runways where designers like Nanette Lepore and Marc Jacobs showcased longer skirts nipped waistlines peplums and tailored jackets The look is simple yet simultaneously glamorous so it s no wonder that starlets like Kirsten Dunst and Diane Kruger have already embraced its old Hollywood appeal We re mad about these 40s inspired looks and are positive you ll love them too There were many different influences that drove 40s fashion which ultimately lead to a variety of silhouettes and key styles many of which were showcased on the runways this season Nanette Lepore addressed the early part of the decade when knitted tailored jackets were wildly popular and often worn with skirts or dresses in similar fabrics In the look above Lepore paired the green tweed Tickle Me Jacket 398 212 219 8265 with matching Seduce Me Skirt 248 212 219 8265 and made the retro look modern by giving the jacket of the moment leather sleeves Over at Louis Vuitton Creative Director Marc Jacobs also channeled the early 40s via a sober color palette and rounded shoulders and collars which can be seen in the Tecno Fur Dress above which was sadly not produced Finally at the Marc Jacobs F W 11 show the designer gave us slimmer unfussy silhouettes that were a nod to the mid 40s For one of our favorite outfits Jacobs paired the Jersey Crepe Round Neck Blouse 995 with the Double Face Stretch Crepe Skirt with Glitter Dots 1400 resulting in an incredibly chic streamlined look Not surprisingly these 40s inspired looks are a smash off the runways as well For example Diane Kruger arrived at a Miu Miu party in Beverly Hills earlier this summer wearing said fashion house s Sable Embroidered Dress 4105 select Miu Miu boutiques with a Suede Clutch 1750 select Miu Miu boutiques We particularly like the frock s bold shoulders and floral emblazoned sleeves floral prints were quite popular during that era which are the epitome of 40s style A few months later at a GQ party during the Toronto International Film Festival Kirsten Dunst opted for a slightly more conservative take on the 40s look when she paired a polka dot Prada blouse with a pleated ankle grazing Chanel skirt We d also like to point out that both ladies opted for half up half down hairdos which further enhances the retro spirit of their after hours ensembles Now that we ve covered both the runway and real way approaches to the 40s look it s time to talk products With loads of fabulous pieces available on the market there are plenty of ways to incorporate a hint of this romantic era into your fall wardrobe We d like to first direct you to Carven s Tailored Flannel Jacket 800 which is a must for anyone hoping to channel the 40s The grayish hue is incredibly versatile plus the padded shoulders make for a bold look We recommend wearing it with a knee length skirt like Robert Rodriguez s Pleated Skirt 295 in Gold as it offers a great contrast to the jacket s sharp tailoring resulting in the ultimate 40s inspired look Dress seekers are sure to fall in love with Rebecca Taylor s Ghost Flower Cut Out Dress 425 212 243 2600 in Black which features a darling print slimming long sleeve and nipped waistline For those of you hoping to put together a more casual take on the trend the Blackmoor Fair Isle Sweater 128 from J Crew is the perfect piece thanks to the crew neckline and intricate stitching When it comes to accessories we think Burberry Prorsum s Medium Hedwig Bowling Bag 2195 212 407 7100 in Bright Caper is a spot on selection Why you may ask Women in the 40s typically opted for smaller bags and clutches so this carrier s ladylike shape and petite size embody the look perfectly Now our footwear pick for today s story was quite easy Diane von Furstenberg s Finn Suede Platform Pumps Finn Suede Platform Pumps 295 in Bottle Green We like that the dark green suede isn t too flashy neutral and darker hues were key in the 40s plus the heel s platform and delicate ankle strap speak to the feminine and elegant fashions of the decade And of course this look wouldn t be complete without a pair of sunnies hence our inclusion of Betsey Johnson s Crazy Cat Eye Sunglasses 55 The retro shades will add just the right amount of 40s flare to your wardrobe this season But wait there s more In addition to clothing and accessories a few key beauty products are essential when achieving the 40s look If you re not a fan of bright red lipstick try China Glaze s Nail Polish 5 in City Siren instead it will give your 40s inspired outfit a sultry finish Finally the era was all about a pretty pink cheek very feminine and natural hence our recommendation of Yves Saint Laurent s Touche Blush 45 in Rose With a powder formula this blush gives you a long lasting natural looking glow that s gorgeous glamorous and essential for that fabulous 40s look Jessica BakerPhotos of Katharine Hepburn and Kirsten Dunst courtesy of Getty Louis Vuitton runway photo courtesy of Louis Vuitton Nanette Lepore runway photo courtesy of

party sues Belleville officer "",""body"":""The city Belleville and a Belleville police officer are being sued by a man who claims he was wrongfully arrested and charged with falsely impersonating a police officer after wearing a T shirt with the word POLICE written across the front and back Adam C Weinstein of Missouri claims he was attending a pre Christmas party on Dec 23 2006 at about 11 34 p m at Crehan s Bar in Belleville according to the complaint filed Dec 22 in St Clair County Circuit Court When Weinstein initially arrived at the party he was wearing a green sweater with the black shirt bearing the word POLICE underneath the sweater After getting hot at the bar Weinstein removed his sweater to reveal the POLICE shirt the suit states Shortly afterwards Weinstein claims he was told that some police officers wanted to talk to him outside Once he arrived outside Weinstein was told to show officers his police identification the suit states But Weinstein was a licensed Emergency Medical Technician and a licensed security officer not a police officer so he had no credentials he claims Belleville police officer Jeff Vernatti placed Weinstein under arrest and placed handcuffs around his wrists but tightened them too tightly on Plaintiff according to the complaint After Weinstein asked if it was illegal to wear a T shirt with the word POLICE on it Vernatti told him to shut the f up you re real f ing stupid you are a dumb a with no common sense do you know how f ing stupid you are the suit states Vernatti then twisted Weinstein s wrists and quickly walked him across the parking lot Weinstein claims Vernatti shoved Weinstein against the police cruiser with such force that his belt buckle left an impression on his abdomen then pushed Weinstein into the back seat of the car according to the complaint When Weinstein asked Vernatti to loosen his handcuffs Vernatti instead tightened them and added a second pair onto his wrists the suit states After writing a non traffic complaint Vernatti let Weinstein go first telling him how lucky he was not to be charged with a felony and to be placed in jail Weinstein claims But before letting Weinstein leave Vernatti ordered him to take off his shirt in the cold weather according to the complaint All the while other Belleville officers stood by and did nothing the suit states Eventually Belleville s prosecuting attorney dropped the case the suit states Because of Vernatti s actions Weinstein suffered extreme emotional distress fright nervousness indignity humiliation insult loss of relationship and comfort and was forced to incur medical costs he claims Vernatti falsely arrested falsely detained illegally violently and improperly handcuffed and wrongly charged Weinstein with impersonating officers Weinstein claims He also used excessive force publicly embarrassed harassed verbally abused physically abused cause grievous and severe injuries to Weinstein violated Weinstein s protected civil rights and abused or misused their powers according to the complaint Vernatti s actions toward Weinstein were extreme and outrageous the suit states The city of Belleville failed to train its police officers in matters that do not constitute an offense failed to train its officers in matters that do not require individuals to be detained failed to implement policies and procedures to prevent against untrained officers from detaining and charging innocent individuals and failed to train and supervise competent police officers the suit states Weinstein claims his injuries were caused by someone who had final policymaking authority and that the city had a widespread practice of deliberate indifference to the prior improper conduct of Vernatti that the city s indifference is exemplified by its knowledge of previous allegations made by citizens of Vernatti s behavior that the city failed to investigate allegations and that the city failed to discipline Vernatti Belleville also failed to train other officers to stop Vernatti when he violated rights should have known that Vernatti had been accused of excessive force on at least one prior occasion and failed to prevent Vernatti s conduct on Dec 23 2006 according to the complaint In the five count suit Weinstein is seeking actual damages in excess of 250 000 punitive damages in excess of 200 000 plus attorney s fees

startling things most people still don't know about the national debt, banking and the money supply"",""body"":""NaturalNews Most people even smart people know surprisingly little about the way money really works in Big Government With the debt ceiling fiasco suddenly raising awareness of the possibility of a total global financial blowout now seems like a good time to remind people of seven disturbing facts about money that are almost never acknowledge in the old media Fact 1 There is no FDIC insurance fund The money at your bank is insured against loss by the FDIC s insurance fund right Nope That s total fiction There is no actual money in the fund The FDIC insurance money has already been looted by the U S Treasury which has simply replaced the money with a bunch of IOUs Why does this matter Because it means that if the U S government goes into default so will the FDIC And that means all your bank funds have zero insurance That s gonna be a big shock for tens of millions of people when they finally figure this out one day Fact 2 There are no social security funds either When you pay social security taxes all that money goes into a trust fund that s held for safekeeping until the day it pays you back right Ha That s the sucker s view of social security that only ignorant people believe In reality there is no money in the social security trust fund because it too has all been looted by the U S Treasury and spent In truth social security is already broke Can t wait for people to wake up and figure this one out either Fact 3 The U S Treasury is stealing money from you every day even if you pay no taxes Here s a mind boggling truth that most people just can t seem to get their heads around The U S Treasury is stealing money from you every single day by the simple fact that they keep creating new money and handing it out to wealthy banksters Well technically this is being done by the Federal Reserve which isn t even part of the federal government But it s all done in cahoots with the Treasury which is eroding the value of your money through these money creation and distribution actions That s why prices keep going up all around you folks Food isn t suddenly worth more money the truth is that your money is worth less That s how the Treasury and the Federal Reserve steal from you without even breaking into your home Probably 99 9 of the population has no understanding of this phenomenon the erosion of currency valuation through the centralized government printing of more currency And yet it is a government scam that has been carried out against citizens of the world time and time again spanning millennia As history has clearly shown every nation that goes down the path of printing more currency to pay its bills eventually ends up in a runaway hyperinflation scenario followed by economic collapse The USA will be no different Fact 4 The balanced solution isn t balanced Don t you love the quirky White House Press Secretary who keeps spewing out the phrase balanced solution even while the debt deal leaves the U S budget entirely unbalanced When you re spending more money than you re earning that s not financial balance When the White House says balanced what it really means is compromised as in half way between the Republican position spend us into purgatory and the Democratic position spend us into oblivion Neither party has any real solution to the cancerous growth of Big Government That s because they are creatures of Big Government Politicians can no more solve the problems of Big Government than arsonists can solve the problem of office fires Because they are themselves creatures of runaway debt spending how else do you get elected these days they simply do not possess the cognitive framework from which real financial solutions must stem Fact 5 The government is going to steal everything from you before it collapsesOh my this is a tough one for people to get their heads around especially those who naively trust governments to act in the interests of the People The simple truth of the matter and I ve publicly made this prediction before is that the government is going to STEAL almost everything you own as it heads toward a total financial implosion This will include The government theft of private retirement accounts The feds will claim they re taking them over for your protection Yeah right And then one day they will simply all vanish Kiss your IRA goodbye The government theft of precious metals Within the next 3 years watch for a national emergency to be declared followed by government confiscation of gold and silver The feds will take your gold and hand you paper money in exchange The paper money of course will be all but worthless shortly thereafter Only the suckers of course will actually turn in their metals Government takeover of your bank accounts As banks begin to fail in the big collapse the government will step in and take ownership of the failed institutions just as it did with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac which used to be publicly owned companies but are now largely just government finance operations This will put your bank accounts under the direct control of the White House which can use executive orders to do things like banning all wire transfers out of the country or limiting daily withdrawals and transfers Sure you ll still own your money in the bank you just won t be able to freely access it Fact 6 Most people have no idea about fractional reserve banking derivatives the money supply or the Federal ReserveIt s not just that most people don t understand banking and finance it s that even members of Congress have no idea how all this works With few exceptions like Ron Paul they re just clueless Get this Even most bankers don t even know how fractional reserve banking really works They don t understand derivatives either which is why they screwed them up so badly in the housing boom that crashed in 2007 And because bankers investors and bureaucrats have no idea how it all works they unwittingly turn it all into a runaway catastrophe Allowing ignorant adults to play with debt and derivatives is like letting infants play with nuclear weapons It can only lead to something messy Fact 7 Most people are betting their lives on the dollarPeople buy insurance for their cars their homes and even their health But when it comes to money 99 out of 100 people in America are betting their entire financial existence on the U S dollar They get their paychecks in dollars their savings accounts are in dollars and all their assets are denominated in dollars As a result they have no diversity to protect them against dollar devaluation That s kinda crazy considering just how quickly the dollar could collapse in the near future and become totally worthless That s why smart people are diversifying their assets and converting dollars into land gold silver or even storable food Here in central Texas even ammunition has a long term barter value that far exceeds dollars Looking around at the financial behaviors of others I m just stunned at how many people are betting everything on the dollar because they never realized they had any other option that s the way the government likes to keep it of course Mark my words folks The great financial collapse of America is now closer than ever While I can t put an exact prediction date on it there s absolutely no doubt that it s coming The morons in Washington aren t doing anything to avoid it either they re all just cashing in as much as they can before the big collapse rolls in Bunch of cowards and crooks running this country They don t understanding banking and finance and they re determined to make sure you don t either Because the less you know about what s really going on the longer they can continue to loot the U S economy while people stand around and do nothing How bad is the situation really Just yesterday Vice President Joe Biden called Congressional Tea Party members terrorists for their insistence that the U S budget be balanced So now the mere idea of calling for a balanced budget turns you into a terrorist to be prosecuted under the Patriot Act And why not Demanding financial sanity MUST be labeled an act of terrorism for our criminal government to continue its own criminal looting operation Next we ll probably see the President ordering the arrest and prosecution of any members of Congress i e terrorists who do not go along with unlimited increased in the debt ceiling Now you see what the terrorism laws are really all about They are legislative weapons to be used against political enemies not actual terrorists Meanwhile Big Government is technically engaged in the use of financial weapons of mass destruction against the People yet no one notices A bizarre world we live in folks It is dominated by the mindless masses and run by criminal sociopaths Those who demand real solutions are labeled terrorists and those who try to explain all this to everybody else are labeled alarmists Just wait until this house of cards collapses though There will be a day of reckoning in which a whole bunch of apologies will be owed to all those people

history yet again during Sunday night s victory over his former team the San Diego Chargers While most sports fans and especially Saints fans realize how great Drew Brees truly is I have the feeling that the man is often snubbed Search for any top or best quarterbacks ever and you probably won t see Drew Brees included While I realize that he has received numerous accolades over his career I feel that he s often overlooked I also realize that making these kinds of lists are incredibly hard Especially when there are guys named Montana Young Elway Manning Brady Marino and Favre to include But there s definitely room for Drew Brees to be included in any and every best QB ever list In fact I m making the argument that he should be in at least the Top 10 of those lists and here s why An Inspiring Leader When we think of the greatest quarterbacks in history we mention men who can not only be a leader but also inspire their team Think of Ray Lewis Despite what we feel about him he s without doubt the leader of the Ravens Drew Brees without doubt is the inspiring leader for the Saints We could talk about how he does it but we think this video pretty much sums it up Championships Of course being named a top QB in a history means that you were able to lead your team to a championship And Drew Brees did that already But what about the folks that say he only has one Super Bowl ring Steve Young Peyton Manning Brett Favre They all have a single Super Bowl victory But let s not forget about Dan Marino He was one of the best ever and has zero rings to show for it So while winning the Super Bowl is important it s not everything But if it does matter to you then Drew has already been there and done that Accomplishments The top players in history should also have amazing stats and have accomplished unimaginable feats Is Drew Brees in there Absolutely Besides being a Super Bowl MVP he s had a number of other career highlights that include 6 Pro Bowl 2004 2006 2008 2009

html"",""title"":""6 Badass Movie Scenes With Horrifying Unseen Consequences 6 badass movie scenes with horrifying unseen consequences 6 badass movie scenes with horrifying unseen consequences"",""body"":""We don t often pause to think about the faceless civilians who get killed in movies Star Wars would be pretty damn depressing if we spent the runtime trying to wrap our heads around the idea that billions of people were killed when Alderaan exploded instead of watching all the pretty colors in the lightsaber battles But there are some movies that go so far out of their way to ignore these deaths that we can t help but wonder about the mental stability of the writers What You See In order to rob a casino Danny Ocean and his many superfluous accomplices need to bring down its security system They accomplish this by stealing and using a pinch which according to Don Cheadle is a device that unleashes an electromagnetic pulse which shuts down any power source within its blast radius It works they get inside the vault and everything goes according to their needlessly convoluted plan But Wait a Minute The electromagnetic pulse didn t just knock out power in the casino when they set it off there s a quick shot of the entire city of Las Vegas going dark The movie then cuts to the inside of the casino they re robbing where we see people trying to steal chips at the black jack table and other fun varieties of chaos they intended So how did the rest of the city do Well keep in mind that according to our merry band of thieves the electromagnetic pulse doesn t just turn the lights off it shuts down every power source within it s blast radius When the plan is devised we re told the city will temporarily be plunged into the 17th Century which is great if you re stealing money and bad news if you re say on life support in a hospital Hospitals have back up systems that come on during a power outage but so do casinos The pinch is being used because it takes those out Hell if we re talking every power source everyone with a pacemaker is dead on the spot But at least they weren t one of the poor bastards in helicopters and passenger planes now making an increasingly less than gradual descent into Las Vegas According to Ocean s Eleven the biggest danger is chorus lines veering off course kicking thousands of audience members to death Ocean s Eleven isn t the only movie to gloss over the casualties of a power outage Live Free or Die Hard features the entire East Coast losing power but the consequences are magically eliminated when the bad guy gets shot The remake of The Day the Earth Stood Still also tries to end on a happy note despite the fact that the entire world gets hit with an electromagnetic pulse But it s especially noticeable in Ocean s Eleven because the charming heroes are the ones responsible It s hard to root for the thieves once you realize they won t let innocent lives stand between them and their loot The sequel to Ocean s Eleven shouldn t have been about the casino owner getting revenge it should have told the story of the FBI hunting down the people responsible for one of the worst terror attacks in American history Which would have been way better than what we actually got What You See A presentation at Tony Stark s expo by his arch rival turns out to be a trap when the packed house is attacked by Mickey Rourke and his small army of killer robots But Iron Man and his best friend manage to destroy the robots kill the villain and save the show Turns out stealing your armor was kind of a good thing Tony But Wait a Minute The robot army split in two half went after Iron Man and half went on a murderous rampage in a crowd of panicking civilians Not a lot of attention was focused on the latter Stark passed on the more traditional superhero priority Stop the threat against innocent people despite great personal risk and instead opted for the unorthodox ignore the problem until it goes away approach You see killbots have a preset kill limit Knowing their weakness I let them slaughter wave after wave of civilians until they reached their limit and shut down Iron Man does nothing to combat the robots attacking the civilians aside from pausing to save one little kid and belatedly suggesting that the drones should be lured to a less crowded area before jetting off again Lure the drones away Great idea Tony Let s get started on getting these people to safety You fly around and find us a safe area to evacu or you could just leave That s good too Even if we ignore Iron Man s questionable superheroics a lot of people were implicitly slaughtered We don t see the bodies because most of the time the focus is on Iron Man fighting off his attackers but every second spent watching him spout wry witticisms with his charming smile is a second in which innocent people are being gunned down offscreen Then for good measure the drones all explode at the end of the battle presumably just to ensure that the wounded don t crawl away to safety Man who would have thought that Stark s plan of letting his suspicious archrival make a secret presentation at his deadly robotics expo would backfire We re very sorry for the difficulties with that last presentation visitors Next up Professor Razorface s KillSpider Armada What You See The Enterprise and her fleet respond to a distress call from the planet Vulcan Upon arrival they encounter the film s villain Nero who wipes out most of the fleet destroys the planet and kidnaps the Enterprise s captain Nero then proceeds to attack Earth but Kirk and the rest manage to stop him in the nick of time But Wait a Minute All right so Spock and the rest pause to mourn the destruction of Vulcan and the death of billions Only for like 30 seconds but it s an action movie and they still have a bad guy to stop It s understandable But what about the fleet that was sent to help Vulcan Every ship that wasn t named Enterprise just got blown to pieces with no word of survivors And since the fleet was made up primarily of cadets and teachers the regular fleet was too far away to help our heroes just lost every single one of their colleagues and friends yet nobody bats an eye You can t argue that they were just faceless nobodies either because we saw some of them earlier in the movie like Uhura s green skinned roommate that Kirk was having kinky interspecies sex with But I had sex with her before she died so I don t see what the problem is Almost the entire population of Starfleet Academy was wiped out in about a minute That s going to make Kirk and Co s return home after the movie awfully depressing and it certainly puts a damper on the awards ceremony at the end Gee where is everyone today Ooh right To make matters worse Nero didn t exactly go down without a fight The Enterprise stopped him but not before he started drilling a massive hole into the ground beneath San Francisco Bay You don t have to be a geologist to understand that having a giant pit blasted into the Earth is bad for the people living in the area especially if that area is prone to earthquakes Like this except a lot bigger a lot deeper on fire and right next to the Golden Gate Bridge Between Starfleet losing all its cadets and the likelihood that its San Francisco academy got sucked down into a portal to hell the upcoming Star Trek sequel should realistically be about Capt Kirk manning a recruitment station at his old high school for a few hours between bouts of grief stricken sobbing we don't often pause to think about the faceless civilians who get killed in movies, and there are some movies that go so far out of their way to ignore these deaths that we can't help but wonder about the mental stability of the

sell it to the highest bidder"",""title"":""They Know Everything About You and Sell it to the Highest Bidder big data brokers: they know everything about you and sell it to the highest bidder"",""body"":""Data companies are scooping up enormous amounts of information about almost every American They sell information about whether you re pregnant or divorced or trying to lose weight about how rich you are and what kinds of cars you have Regulators and some in Congress have been taking a closer look at these so called data brokers and are beginning to push the companies to give consumers more information and control over what happens to their data But many people still don t even know that data brokers exist Here s a look at what we know about the consumer data industry How much do these companies know about individual people They start with the basics like names addresses and contact information and add on demographics like age race occupation and education level according to consumer data firm Acxiom s overview of its various categories But that s just the beginning The companies collect lists of people experiencing life event triggers like getting married buying a home sending a kid to college or even getting divorced Credit reporting giant Experian has a separate marketing services division which sells lists of names of expectant parents and families with newborns that are updated weekly The companies also collect data about your hobbies and many of the purchases you make Want to buy a list of people who read romance novels Epsilon can sell you that as well as a list of people who donate to international aid charities A subsidiary of credit reporting company Equifax even collects detailed salary and paystub information for roughly 38 percent of employed Americans as NBC news reported As part of handling employee verification requests the company gets the information directly from employers Equifax said in a statement that the information is only sold to customers who have been verified through a detailed credentialing process It added that if a mortgage company or other lender wants to access information about your salary they must obtain your permission to do so Of course data companies typically don t have all of this information on any one person As Acxiom notes in its overview No individual record ever contains all the possible data And some of the data these companies sell is really just a guess about your background or preferences based on the characteristics of your neighborhood or other people in a similar age or demographic group Where are they getting all this info The stores where you shop sell it to them Datalogix for instance which collects information from store loyalty cards says it has information on more than 1 trillion in consumer spending across 1400 leading brands It doesn t say which ones Datalogix did not respond to our requests for comment Data companies usually refuse to say exactly what companies sell them information citing competitive reasons And retailers also don t make it easy for you to find out whether they re selling your information But thanks to California s Shine the Light law researchers at U C Berkeley were able to get a small glimpse of how companies sell or share your data The study recruited volunteers to ask more than 80 companies how the volunteers information was being shared Only two companies actually responded with details about how volunteers information had been shared Upscale furniture store Restoration Hardware said that it had sent your name address and what you purchased to seven other companies including a data cooperative that allows retailers to pool data about customer transactions and another company that later became part of Datalogix Restoration Hardware hasn t responded to our request for comment Walt Disney also responded and described sharing even more information not just a person s name and address and what they purchased but their age occupation and the number age and gender of their children It listed companies that received data among them companies owned by Disney like ABC and ESPN as well as others including Honda HarperCollins Publishing Almay cosmetics and yogurt company Dannon But Disney spokeswoman Zenia Mucha said that Disney s letter sent in 2007 wasn t clear about how the data was actually shared with different companies on the list Outside companies like Honda only received personal information as part of a contest sweepstakes or other joint promotion that they had done with Disney Mucha said The data was shared for the fulfillment of that contest prize not for their own marketing purposes Where else do data brokers get information about me Government records and other publicly available information including some sources that may surprise you Your state Department of Motor Vehicles for instance may sell personal information like your name address and the type of vehicles you own to data companies although only for certain permitted purposes including identify verification Public voting records which include information about your party registration and how often you vote can also be bought and sold for commercial purposes in some states Are there limits to the kinds of data these companies can buy and sell Yes certain kinds of sensitive data are protected but much of your information can be bought and sold without any input from you Federal law protects the confidentiality of your medical records and your conversations with your doctor There are also strict rules regarding the sale of information used to determine your credit worthiness or your eligibility for employment insurance and housing For instance consumers have the right to view and correct their own credit reports and potential employers have to ask for your consent before they buy a credit report about you Other than certain kinds of protected data including medical records and data used for credit reports consumers have no legal right to control or even monitor how information about them is bought and sold As the FTC notes There are no current laws requiring data brokers to maintain the privacy of consumer data unless they use that data for credit employment insurance housing or other similar purposes So they don t sell information about my health Actually they do Data companies can capture information about your interests in certain health conditions based on what you buy or what you search for online Datalogix has lists of people classified as allergy sufferers and dieters Acxiom sells data on whether an individual has an online search propensity for a certain ailment or prescription Consumer data is also beginning to be used to evaluate whether you re making healthy choices One health insurance company recently bought data on more than three million people s consumer purchases in order to flag health related actions like purchasing plus sized clothing the Wall Street Journal reported The company bought purchasing information for current plan members not as part of screening people for potential coverage Spokeswoman Michelle Douglas said that Blue Cross and Blue Shield of North Carolina would use the data to target free programming offers to their customers Douglas suggested that it might be more valuable for companies to use consumer data to determine ways to help me improve my health rather than to buy my data to send me pre paid credit card applications or catalogs full of stuff they want me to buy Do companies collect information about my social media profiles and what I do online Yes As we highlighted last year some data companies record and then resell all kinds of information you post online including your screen names website addresses interests hometown and professional history and how many friends or followers you have Acxiom said it collects information about which social media sites individual people use and whether they are a heavy or a light user but that they do not collect information about individual postings or your lists of friends More traditional consumer data can also be connected with information about what you do online Datalogix the company that collects loyalty card data has partnered with Facebook to track whether Facebook users who see ads for certain products actually end up buying them at local stores as the Financial Times reported last year Is there a way to find out exactly what these data companies know about me Not really You have the right to review and correct your credit report But with marketing data there s often no way to know exactly what information is attached to your name or whether it s accurate Most companies offer at best a partial picture While Acxiom lets consumers review some of the information the company sells about them New York Times reporter Natasha Singer discovered this summer that only a sliver of information is shared including whether you have a prison record or bankruptcy filings When Singer finally received her report all it included was a record of her residential addresses Some companies do offer more access A spokeswoman for Epsilon said it allows consumers to review high level information about their data like whether or not you re listed as making a purchase in the home furnishings category Requests to review this information cost 5 and can only be made by postal mail RapLeaf a company that advertises that it has real time data on 80 percent of U S email addresses says that it gives customers total control over the data we have on you and allows them to review and edit the categories like estimated household income and Likely Political Contributor to Republicans that RapLeaf has connected with their email addresses How do I know when someone has purchased data about me Most of the time you don t When you re checking out at a store and a cashier asks you for your Zip code the store isn t just getting that single piece of information Acxiom and other data companies offer services that allow stores to use your Zip code and the name on your credit card to pinpoint your home address without asking you for it directly Is there any way to stop the companies from collecting and sharing information about me Yes but it would require a whole lot of work Many data brokers offer consumers the chance to opt out of being included in their databases or at least from receiving advertising enabled by that company Rapleaf for instance has a Permanent opt out that deletes information associated with your email address from the Rapleaf database But to actually opt out effectively you need to know about all the different data brokers and where to find their opt outs Most consumers of course don t have that information In their privacy report last year the FTC suggested that data brokers should create a centralized website that would make it easier for consumers to learn about the existence of these companies and their rights regarding the data they collect How many people do these companies have information on Basically everyone in the U S and many beyond it Acxiom recently profiled by the New York Times says it has information on 500 million people worldwide including nearly every U S consumer After the 9 11 attacks CNN reported Acxiom was able to locate 11 of the 19 hijackers in its database How is all of this data actually used Mostly to sell you stuff Companies want to buy lists of people who might be interested in what they re selling and also want to learn more about their current customers They also sell their information for other purposes including identity verification fraud prevention and background checks If new privacy laws are passed will they include the right to see what data these companies have collected about me Unlikely In a report on privacy last year the Federal Trade Commission recommended that Congress pass legislation that would provide consumers with access to information about them held by a data broker President Barack Obama has also proposed a Consumer Privacy Bill of Rights that would give consumers the right to access and correct certain information about them But this probably won t include access to marketing data which the Federal Trade Commission considers less sensitive than data used for credit reports or identity verification In terms of marketing data we think at the very least consumers should have access to the general categories of data the companies have about consumers said Maneesha Mithal of the FTC s Division of Privacy and Identity Protection Data companies have also pushed back against the idea of opening up marketing profiles for individual consumers inspection Even if there were errors in your marketing data profile the worst thing that could happen is that you get an advertising offer that isn t relevant to you said Rachel Thomas the vice president of government affairs at the Direct Marketing Association The fraud and security risks that you run by opening up those files is higher than any potential harm that could happen to the consumer Thomas

cupcakes."",""body"":""Big picture That s what these are big picture cupcakes As in make these for someone you really really REALLY like big picture cupcakes Or like try to think about the big picture when you stop to pump gas into your car decide to do a good deed for yourself and throw away some random gum wrappers water bottles receipts and um the remnants of about 16 granola bars while you re fueling up and then proceed to THROW YOUR CAR KEY into the trash can along with everything else The trash can at the gas station Only one of the dirtiest places on Earth But don t worry try to think big picture This is just a blip on the radar At least that s what my husband told me yesterday when I said that I absolutely NEEDED this purse that was on sale but I feel like I shouldn t buy it and did he think I should buy it and he goes uh you already have that purse in a different color and I mentally curse myselft for marrying someone metrosexual Well as metrosexual as you can get with cutting all the sleeves off your NASCAR t shirts but still I responded that duh I WAAAAAS thinking big picture like dreaming about how cute this purse would look in July and August which is sooo far away and even how next year it will still be in style and didn t he know that this is majorly big picture thinking I guess that s not what he had in mind Hmmpf Too bad we made the best move ever post marriage which included never combining our bank accounts and remaining independent Worst move ever not living together before Can you say drop down drag out fights These cupcakes ARE big picture cupcakes though They are one of those cupcakes that you remember One that you crave One that becomes a staple especially when you can make 24 of them and keep them in your freezer and then eat one with extra peanut butter chocolate ganache for dinner But really my dinner last night was sourdough pretzels dipped in crazy feta with a side of peanut butter chocolate ganache But who cares It s no secret that I loath all things coffee uh hello dirty water EXCEPT for coffee ice cream It became my mission in life to make all coffee like drinks taste identical to coffee ice cream which has been fabulous and horrible all rolled into one because then I can t stop consuming them and I feel like I m on speed And I talk a lot I like to think that I inherited my coffee ice cream fascination from my grandparents who always had a half gallon in their freezer Unlike me though they were able to consume it in normal sized portions like a little cup here and a little taste there Not like a large spoon before breakfast and a soup bowl s worth for dessert Then Cold Stone appeared and they flaunted this creation called mud pie mojo in my face complete with coffee ice cream fudge Oreos and peanut butter mashed into one I mean they practically forced it down my throat For die hard coffee fans the combination may sound heinous but it truly just WORKS And that s how we ended up here Obviously these cupcakes take a bit more work than boring regular mini cakes you need the time and patience for a few easy steps as well as the space in your freezer to store these little chunks o love but I promise they are 100 worth it They take away all your worries of the big picture Because what else do you need besides cupcakes Peanut Butter Fudge Coffee Ice Cream Cupcakes cake recipe from these pb

mistakes but he never makes the biggest mistake of all doing nothing Benjamin Franklin Entering the weight room is the first step to building muscle but it s not the last What you do before during and after a workout can either annihilate your hard work or elevate your growth to a whole new level Your personal habits your social life even which exercises you choose to do can take away from what you re trying to build In the following post I will try to pinpoint ten factors that sabotage your results Add them up and they could be why your muscles have nothing to show for all your time served But only 1 percent of your time should be spent on problems 99 percent should be spent on solutions So in that spirit after I bring each saboteur to your attention I ll give you a solution oriented tip 1 Winging it Peter Drucker once said that Action without planning is the biggest cause of failure and I believe that statement is 100 accurate Winging it means having no written goals or plans no training journal and no way of keeping score It s when you just show up at the gym day after day and do whatever strikes your fancy whatever machine happens to be available or whatever you ve become habitually accustomed to doing Winging it is when you don t know where you are where you re going or how you re going to get there but you start your journey anyway no compass no roadmap Fix it Always have a plan Strategic planning is a never ending process and includes Assessment where are you now goal setting where do you want to go creating a plan or strategy how will you get where you want to go executing the plan what action steps you must take daily to reach your goal and measuring results how will you know if you re moving towards your goal and how will you know when you ve reached it Boneheads wing it Butt kickers have a master plan and goals for every workout 2 Skipping basics Plenty of weightlifters believe that doing isolation exercises like chest flies and leg extensions is the only way to make their muscles grow But basic moves such as bench presses and squats force several muscle groups to work together imposing more stress on your body for bigger gains Your body reacts to all that stress by having the anterior pituitary gland issue more growth hormone to compensate for the extra effort Of course you need variation but don t abandon basic moves in favor of intermediate isolation exercises Fix it Write down the exercises in your routine to see what percentage of them are compound moves If it s not in the range of at least 40 50 percent then you re doing too many isolation exercises 3 No warm up Jumping into your workout routine without a proper warm up or finishing without a proper cool down is a sure fire way to set yourself up for acute injuries during the workout or chronic injuries over time Fix it The best warm up is to simply do an easier version of whatever your full workout is going to be For example if you are going for a run on the treadmill start first by walking then jogging and then move into your full running pace Or if you are doing a strength training workout do your first set of each exercise with lighter weights do your second set with heavier weights and your third set with your heaviest weights for that exercise Your body responds best and you reduce your risk of injury when you build intensity slowly rather than quickly So always leave yourself a few extra moments for warming up 4 Poor technique Doing an exercise too quickly or executing a move with sloppy form can increase your risk of injury And an injury can interrupt your workout program and make it difficult to be consistent and get results Fix it Remember to do your exercises slowly and with good form If you are not sure how to do an exercise ask a trainer or follow the instructions that are usually located directly on the machine If you are new to an exercise class show up early and ask the instructor to show you the tougher moves before class starts so you know how to do them properly If you can t find instructions or get assistance skip the exercise and do an exercise that is more familiar to you When doing any new exercise or movement take your time and do it extra slow as this will reduce your risk of injury if your technique is not perfect 5 Extra sport Engaging in sport too often can sidetrack your muscle growth goals Muscles usually need 48 hours of rest to adapt to the stresses placed on them during exercise Engaging in extra activity also makes your body more likely to use any excess kilojoules it has for fuel and not for rebuilding itself Fix it Pull your cardiovascular activity back to the bare minimum twenty minutes three times a week to see what effect it has on your body If cardio is indeed stealing your muscle you should begin to notice strength improvements being able to lift more weight or complete more repetitions within two to three weeks If your number one goal is to increase muscle size and strength and not necessarily to build overall health try pulling back further Can t miss a game During your workout ease up on the muscles you use most in your extra activity so they have more time to recover 6 Starving yourself You need to eat after your workout Right after a session your body is hustling to convert glucose into glycogen so your muscles can repair themselves and grow So if you re not going to eat after your exercise your body will start to break down muscle into amino acids to convert into glucose Fix it After you work out eat a high carbohydrate meal and don t forget the protein A recent study in the Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research found that a four to one carbohydrate to protein ratio can provide 127 percent greater muscle glycogen storage than a high carbohydrate drink alone For even greater results have a sports drink before and during exercise 7 Too little sleep If you don t get enough deep sleep your muscles can t recover Besides when you work out on insufficient sleep you exercise at a lower intensity than you realize but you feel as if it s high So your muscles are less likely to receive enough stress to grow Fix it Go to bed and wake up at set times every day even on weekends to keep your sleep cycles regular In addition avoid caffeine and perhaps exercise for four to six hours before bedtime 8 Thirst For the active adult eating about a gram of protein for every kilogram of body weight helps build muscle if the protein is processed correctly A high protein meal has a slight diuretic effect when the body uses protein for energy it has to remove the nitrogen component of the molecule to turn it into glucose This requires plenty of water Fix it Drink eight to ten glasses of water a day and divide your protein among five or six small meals throughout the day Eating an average of 25 30g each meal is ideal You ll put less stress on your kidneys and you ll also utilize more of the protein you re ingesting by giving your body only as much as it can use each time 9 Sugar Sugary drinks can fool your body with a blood sugar spike making you prone to skip other nutrient dense foods you could be eating Therefore if your sugar habit limits your intake of muscle building amino acids it will sap the fuel you need for your workouts Fix it Water and low sugar sports drinks are your best bets But sugar hides elsewhere Watch out for dried fruits certain nutrition bars and even tomato sauce 10 Smoking and drinking You know smoking is foolish You know you re gambling with cancer stroke and other health issues But did you know you re also sabotaging your strength training Smoking places carbon monoxide in your system which prevents your muscles from getting as much oxygen to use for energy The less oxygen your muscles have to draw from the less efficient they are at contracting which can limit their capacity for work Regarding alcohol it can cover your abs with a layer of lard and interfere with hormones that help build them Drinking alcohol regularly can keep testosterone levels lower than usual and decrease muscle mass Fix it Stop smoking and don t worry about becoming a cold turkey butterball Thirty minutes of exercise three or four times a week helps control body weight and produces positive psychological effects that might diminish the need to smoke Furthermore drinking moderately two drinks or less per day won t harm testosterone levels and can actually improve your cardiovascular health You put in the time the sweat maybe the tears but you don t see results Quit blubbering It will be fine Annihilate these ten saboteurs and watch your muscles grow with nothing holding them back If you liked this article please bookmark it on del icio us or vote for it on Digg Thank you the

children typically take naps in the afternoon our culture generally frowns upon mid day sleep However even in those who get enougth sleep many people experience a natural decrease in drowsiness in the afternoon about 8 hours after waking Reserch shows that you can make yourself more alert reduce stress and improve cognitive functioning with a nap Mid day sleep or a power nap means more patience less stress increased learning better health better reaction time more efficiency and also many athletes find a daytime nap further increases their body s ability to build muscle Napping also benefits heart functioning hormonal maintenance and cell repair says Dr Sara Mednick a scientist at the Salk Institute for Biologicak Studies A power nap says Mednick simply maximizes these benefits by getting the sleeper into and out of rejuvenative sleep as fast as possible No surprise that Lance Armstrong s coach Chris Carmichael says that naps were critical in his overall training plan In Manhattan napping has become a lucrative business MetroNaps in the Empire State Building provides darkened cot like redoubts that attract Broadway actors between shows as well as investment bankers who otherwise would fall asleep at their desks And in Iraq U S Marine commanders have mandated a power nap before patrols Christopher Ketcham at Men s Journal has written a great article on power nap And here s how he explains power nap works Here s how the power nap works Sleep comes in five stages that recur cyclically throughout a typical night and a power nap seeks to include just the first two of them The initial stage features the sinking into sleep as electrical brain activity eye and jaw muscle movement and respiration slow The second is a light but restful sleep in which the body gets ready lowering temperature relaxing muscles further for the entry into the deep and dreamless slow wave sleep or SWS that occurs in stages three and four Stage five of course is REM when the eyes twitch and dreaming becomes intense The five stages repeat every 90 to 120 minutes Stage one can last up to 10 minutes stage two until the 20th minute Extenuating circumstances like manning the controls of a jet aside experts believe that the optimal power nap should roughly coincide with the first 20 minutes in order to give you full access to stage two s restorative benefits In addition to generally improving alertness and stamina stage two is marked by a certain electrical signals in the nervous system that seem to solidify the connection between neurons involved in muscle memory It s like a welding machine says Mednick When you wake up your neurons perform the same function as before but now faster and with more accuracy making the 20 minute nap indispensible to the hard working athlete looking to straighten out his putter or baseline shot The only catch is that you have to carefully time your nap to avoid waking in slow wave sleep third stage which can produce sleep inertia So it s better to use an alarm clock in the beginning So how to get the perfect nap Everyone no matter how high strung has the capacity to nap but the conditions need to be right Here are some helpful hints by Dr Sara Mednick 1 The first consideration is psychological Recognize that you re not being lazy napping will make you more productive and more alert after you wake up 2 Try to nap in the morning or just after lunch human circadian rhythms make late afternoons a more likely time to fall into deep slow wave sleep which will leave you groggy 3 Avoid consuming large quantities of caffeine as well as foods that are heavy in fat and sugar which meddle with a person s ability to fall asleep 4 Instead in the hour or two before your nap time eat foods high in calcium and protein which promote sleep 5 Find a clean quiet place where passersby and phones won t disturb you 6 Try to darken your nap zone or wear an eyeshade Darkness stimulates melatonin the sleep inducing hormone 7 Remember that body temperature drops when you fall asleep Raise the room temperature or use a blanket 8 Once you are relaxed and in position to fall asleep set your alarm for the desired duration see below How Long Is A Good Nap THE NANO NAP 10 to 20 seconds Sleep studies haven t yet concluded whether there are benefits to these brief intervals like when you nod off on someone s shoulder on the train THE MICRO NAP two to five minutes Shown to be surprisingly effective at shedding sleepiness THE MINI NAP five to 20 minutes Increases alertness stamina motor learning and motor performance THE ORIGINAL POWER NAP 20 minutes Includes the benefits of the micro and the mini but additionally improves muscle memory and clears the brain of useless built up information which helps with long term memory remembering facts events and names THE LAZY MAN S NAP 50 to 90 minutes Includes slow wave plus REM sleep good for improving perceptual processing also when the system is flooded with human growth hormone great for repairing bones and muscles If you liked this article please bookmark it on del icio us or vote for it on Digg Thank you while small children typically take naps in the

of Stretching by Brad Appleton brad bradapp net http www bradapp net Go to the previous next chapter The purpose of this chapter is to introduce you to some of the basic physiological concepts that come into play when a muscle is stretched Concepts will be introduced initially with a general overview and then for those who want to know the gory details will be discussed in further detail If you aren t all that interested in this aspect of stretching you can skip this chapter Other sections will refer to important concepts from this chapter and you can easily look them up on a need to know basis Together muscles and bones comprise what is called the musculoskeletal system of the body The bones provide posture and structural support for the body and the muscles provide the body with the ability to move by contracting and thus generating tension The musculoskeletal system also provides protection for the body s internal organs In order to serve their function bones must be joined together by something The point where bones connect to one another is called a joint and this connection is made mostly by ligaments along with the help of muscles Muscles are attached to the bone by tendons Bones tendons and ligaments do not possess the ability as muscles do to make your body move Muscles are very unique in this respect Muscles vary in shape and in size and serve many different purposes Most large muscles like the hamstrings and quadriceps control motion Other muscles like the heart and the muscles of the inner ear perform other functions At the microscopic level however all muscles share the same basic structure At the highest level the whole muscle is composed of many strands of tissue called fascicles These are the strands of muscle that we see when we cut red meat or poultry Each fascicle is composed of fasciculi which are bundles of muscle fibers The muscle fibers are in turn composed of tens of thousands of thread like myofybrils which can contract relax and elongate lengthen The myofybrils are in turn composed of up to millions of bands laid end to end called sarcomeres Each sarcomere is made of overlapping thick and thin filaments called myofilaments The thick and thin myofilaments are made up of contractile proteins primarily actin and myosin How Muscles Contract The way in which all these various levels of the muscle operate is as follows Nerves connect the spinal column to the muscle The place where the nerve and muscle meet is called the neuromuscular junction When an electrical signal crosses the neuromuscular junction it is transmitted deep inside the muscle fibers Inside the muscle fibers the signal stimulates the flow of calcium which causes the thick and thin myofilaments to slide across one another When this occurs it causes the sarcomere to shorten which generates force When billions of sarcomeres in the muscle shorten all at once it results in a contraction of the entire muscle fiber When a muscle fiber contracts it contracts completely There is no such thing as a partially contracted muscle fiber Muscle fibers are unable to vary the intensity of their contraction relative to the load against which they are acting If this is so then how does the force of a muscle contraction vary in strength from strong to weak What happens is that more muscle fibers are recruited as they are needed to perform the job at hand The more muscle fibers that are recruited by the central nervous system the stronger the force generated by the muscular contraction Fast and Slow Muscle Fibers The energy which produces the calcium flow in the muscle fibers comes from mitochondria the part of the muscle cell that converts glucose blood sugar into energy Different types of muscle fibers have different amounts of mitochondria The more mitochondria in a muscle fiber the more energy it is able to produce Muscle fibers are categorized into slow twitch fibers and fast twitch fibers Slow twitch fibers also called Type 1 muscle fibers are slow to contract but they are also very slow to fatigue Fast twitch fibers are very quick to contract and come in two varieties Type 2A muscle fibers which fatigue at an intermediate rate and Type 2B muscle fibers which fatigue very quickly The main reason the slow twitch fibers are slow to fatigue is that they contain more mitochondria than fast twitch fibers and hence are able to produce more energy Slow twitch fibers are also smaller in diameter than fast twitch fibers and have increased capillary blood flow around them Because they have a smaller diameter and an increased blood flow the slow twitch fibers are able to deliver more oxygen and remove more waste products from the muscle fibers which decreases their fatigability These three muscle fiber types Types 1 2A and 2B are contained in all muscles in varying amounts Muscles that need to be contracted much of the time like the heart have a greater number of Type 1 slow fibers When a muscle first starts to contract it is primarily Type 1 fibers that are initially activated then Type 2A and Type 2B fibers are activated if needed in that order The fact that muscle fibers are recruited in this sequence is what provides the ability to execute brain commands with such fine tuned tuned muscle responses It also makes the Type 2B fibers difficult to train because they are not activated until most of the Type 1 and Type 2A fibers have been recruited HFLTA states that the the best way to remember the difference between muscles with predominantly slow twitch fibers and muscles with predominantly fast twitch fibers is to think of white meat and dark meat Dark meat is dark because it has a greater number of slow twitch muscle fibers and hence a greater number of mitochondria which are dark White meat consists mostly of muscle fibers which are at rest much of the time but are frequently called on to engage in brief bouts of intense activity This muscle tissue can contract quickly but is fast to fatigue and slow to recover White meat is lighter in color than dark meat because it contains fewer mitochondria Located all around the muscle and its fibers are connective tissues Connective tissue is composed of a base substance and two kinds of protein based fiber The two types of fiber are collagenous connective tissue and elastic connective tissue Collagenous connective tissue consists mostly of collagen hence its name and provides tensile strength Elastic connective tissue consists mostly of elastin and as you might guess from its name provides elasticity The base substance is called mucopolysaccharide and acts as both a lubricant allowing the fibers to easily slide over one another and as a glue holding the fibers of the tissue together into bundles The more elastic connective tissue there is around a joint the greater the range of motion in that joint Connective tissues are made up of tendons ligaments and the fascial sheaths that envelop or bind down muscles into separate groups These fascial sheaths or fascia are named according to where they are located in the muscles endomysium The innermost fascial sheath that envelops individual muscle fibers perimysium The fascial sheath that binds groups of muscle fibers into individual fasciculi see section Muscle Composition epimysium The outermost fascial sheath that binds entire fascicles see section Muscle Composition These connective tissues help provide suppleness and tone to the muscles When muscles cause a limb to move through the joint s range of motion they usually act in the following cooperating groups agonists These muscles cause the movement to occur They create the normal range of movement in a joint by contracting Agonists are also referred to as prime movers since they are the muscles that are primarily responsible for generating the movement antagonists These muscles act in opposition to the movement generated by the agonists and are responsible for returning a limb to its initial position synergists These muscles perform or assist in performing the same set of joint motion as the agonists Synergists are sometimes referred to as neutralizers because they help cancel out or neutralize extra motion from the agonists to make sure that the force generated works within the desired plane of motion fixators These muscles provide the necessary support to assist in holding the rest of the body in place while the movement occurs Fixators are also sometimes called stabilizers As an example when you flex your knee your hamstring contracts and to some extent so does your gastrocnemius calf and lower buttocks Meanwhile your quadriceps are inhibited relaxed and lengthened somewhat so as not to resist the flexion see section Reciprocal Inhibition In this example the hamstring serves as the agonist or prime mover the quadricep serves as the antagonist and the calf and lower buttocks serve as the synergists Agonists and antagonists are usually located on opposite sides of the affected joint like your hamstrings and quadriceps or your triceps and biceps while synergists are usually located on the same side of the joint near the agonists Larger muscles often call upon their smaller neighbors to function as synergists The following is a list of commonly used agonist antagonist muscle pairs pectorals latissimus dorsi pecs and lats anterior deltoids posterior deltoids front and back shoulder trapezius deltoids traps and delts abdominals spinal erectors abs and lower back left and right external obliques sides quadriceps hamstrings quads and hams shins calves biceps triceps forearm flexors extensors The contraction of a muscle does not necessarily imply that the muscle shortens it only means that tension has been generated Muscles can contract in the following ways isometric contraction This is a contraction in which no movement takes place because the load on the muscle exceeds the tension generated by the contracting muscle This occurs when a muscle attempts to push or pull an immovable object isotonic contraction This is a contraction in which movement does take place because the tension generated by the contracting muscle exceeds the load on the muscle This occurs when you use your muscles to successfully push or pull an object Isotonic contractions are further divided into two types concentric contraction This is a contraction in which the muscle decreases in length shortens against an opposing load such as lifting a weight up eccentric contraction This is a contraction in which the muscle increases in length lengthens as it resists a load such as lowering a weight down in a slow controlled fashion During a concentric contraction the muscles that are shortening serve as the agonists and hence do all of the work During an eccentric contraction the muscles that are lengthening serve as the agonists and do all of the work See section Cooperating Muscle Groups The stretching of a muscle fiber begins with the sarcomere see section Muscle Composition the basic unit of contraction in the muscle fiber As the sarcomere contracts the area of overlap between the thick and thin myofilaments increases As it stretches this area of overlap decreases allowing the muscle fiber to elongate Once the muscle fiber is at its maximum resting length all the sarcomeres are fully stretched additional stretching places force on the surrounding connective tissue see section Connective Tissue As the tension increases the collagen fibers in the connective tissue align themselves along the same line of force as the tension Hence when you stretch the muscle fiber is pulled out to its full length sarcomere by sarcomere and then the connective tissue takes up the remaining slack When this occurs it helps to realign any disorganized fibers in the direction of the tension This realignment is what helps to rehabilitate scarred tissue back to health When a muscle is stretched some of its fibers lengthen but other fibers may remain at rest The current length of the entire muscle depends upon the number of stretched fibers similar to the way that the total strength of a contracting muscle depends on the number of recruited fibers contracting According to SynerStretch you should think of little pockets of fibers distributed throughout the muscle body stretching and other fibers simply going along for the ride The more fibers that are stretched the greater the length developed by the stretched muscle Proprioceptors The nerve endings that relay all the information about the musculoskeletal system to the central nervous system are called proprioceptors Proprioceptors also called mechanoreceptors are the source of all proprioception the perception of one s own body position and movement The proprioceptors detect any changes in physical displacement movement or position and any changes in tension or force within the body They are found in all nerve endings of the joints muscles and tendons The proprioceptors related to stretching are located in the tendons and in the muscle fibers There are two kinds of muscle fibers intrafusal muscle fibers and extrafusal muscle fibers Extrafusil fibers are the ones that contain myofibrils see section Muscle Composition and are what is usually meant when we talk about muscle fibers Intrafusal fibers are also called muscle spindles and lie parallel to the extrafusal fibers Muscle spindles or stretch receptors are the primary proprioceptors in the muscle Another proprioceptor that comes into play during stretching is located in the tendon near the end of the muscle fiber and is called the golgi tendon organ A third type of proprioceptor called a pacinian corpuscle is located close to the golgi tendon organ and is responsible for detecting changes in movement and pressure within the body When the extrafusal fibers of a muscle lengthen so do the intrafusal fibers muscle spindles The muscle spindle contains two different types of fibers or stretch receptors which are sensitive to the change in muscle length and the rate of change in muscle length When muscles contract it places tension on the tendons where the golgi tendon organ is located The golgi tendon organ is sensitive to the change in tension and the rate of change of the tension The Stretch Reflex When the muscle is stretched so is the muscle spindle see section Proprioceptors The muscle spindle records the change in length and how fast and sends signals to the spine which convey this information This triggers the stretch reflex also called the myotatic reflex which attempts to resist the change in muscle length by causing the stretched muscle to contract The more sudden the change in muscle length the stronger the muscle contractions will be plyometric or jump training is based on this fact This basic function of the muscle spindle helps to maintain muscle tone and to protect the body from injury One of the reasons for holding a stretch for a prolonged period of time is that as you hold the muscle in a stretched position the muscle spindle habituates becomes accustomed to the new length and reduces its signaling Gradually you can train your stretch receptors to allow greater lengthening of the muscles Some sources suggest that with extensive training the stretch reflex of certain muscles can be controlled so that there is little or no reflex contraction in response to a sudden stretch While this type of control provides the opportunity for the greatest gains in flexibility it also provides the greatest risk of injury if used improperly Only consummate professional athletes and dancers at the top of their sport or art are believed to actually possess this level of muscular control Components of the Stretch Reflex The stretch reflex has both a dynamic component and a static component The static component of the stretch reflex persists as long as the muscle is being stretched The dynamic component of the stretch reflex which can be very powerful lasts for only a moment and is in response to the initial sudden increase in muscle length The reason that the stretch reflex has two components is because there are actually two kinds of intrafusal muscle fibers nuclear chain fibers which are responsible for the static component and nuclear bag fibers which are responsible for the dynamic component Nuclear chain fibers are long and thin and lengthen steadily when stretched When these fibers are stretched the stretch reflex nerves increase their firing rates signaling as their length steadily increases This is the static component of the stretch reflex Nuclear bag fibers bulge out at the middle where they are the most elastic The stretch sensing nerve ending for these fibers is wrapped around this middle area which lengthens rapidly when the fiber is stretched The outer middle areas in contrast act like they are filled with viscous fluid they resist fast stretching then gradually extend under prolonged tension So when a fast stretch is demanded of these fibers the middle takes most of the stretch at first then as the outer middle parts extend the middle can shorten somewhat So the nerve that senses stretching in these fibers fires rapidly with the onset of a fast stretch then slows as the middle section of the fiber is allowed to shorten again This is the dynamic component of the stretch reflex a strong signal to contract at the onset of a rapid increase in muscle length followed by slightly higher than normal signaling which gradually decreases as the rate of change of the muscle length decreases The Lengthening Reaction When muscles contract possibly due to the stretch reflex they produce tension at the point where the muscle is connected to the tendon where the golgi tendon organ is located The golgi tendon organ records the change in tension and the rate of change of the tension and sends signals to the spine to convey this information see section Proprioceptors When this tension exceeds a certain threshold it triggers the lengthening reaction which inhibits the muscles from contracting and causes them to relax Other names for this reflex are the inverse myotatic reflex autogenic inhibition and the clasped knife reflex This basic function of the golgi tendon organ helps to protect the muscles tendons and ligaments from injury The lengthening reaction is possible only because the signaling of golgi tendon organ to the spinal cord is powerful enough to overcome the signaling of the muscle spindles telling the muscle to contract Another reason for holding a stretch for a prolonged period of time is to allow this lengthening reaction to occur thus helping the stretched muscles to relax It is easier to stretch or lengthen a muscle when it is not trying to contract Reciprocal Inhibition When an agonist contracts in order to cause the desired motion it usually forces the antagonists to relax see section Cooperating Muscle Groups This phenomenon is called reciprocal inhibition because the antagonists are inhibited from contracting This is sometimes called reciprocal innervation but that term is really a misnomer since it is the agonists which inhibit relax the antagonists The antagonists do not actually innervate cause the contraction of the agonists Such inhibition of the antagonistic muscles is not necessarily required In fact co contraction can occur When you perform a sit up one would normally assume that the stomach muscles inhibit the contraction of the muscles in the lumbar or lower region of the back In this particular instance however the back muscles spinal erectors also contract This is one reason why sit ups are good for strengthening the back as well as the stomach When stretching it is easier to stretch a muscle that is relaxed than to stretch a muscle that is contracting By taking advantage of the situations when reciprocal inhibition does occur you can get a more effective stretch by inducing the antagonists to relax during the stretch due to the contraction of the agonists You also want to relax any muscles used as synergists by the muscle you are trying to stretch For example when you stretch your calf you want to contract the shin muscles the antagonists of the calf by flexing your foot However the hamstrings use the calf as a synergist so you want to also relax the hamstrings by contracting the quadricep i e keeping your leg straight Go to the previous next chapter "",""url"":""cmcrossroads bradapp docs rec stretching stretching 2

Chapter 7 is generally the least complicated way to use bankruptcy to get control of your financial life.  Unless you are trying to save a home or you earn too much, chapter 7 bankruptcy is almost always the best option for you.  It is important to consult with a knowledgeable attorney to determine which chapter of the bankruptcy code is right for you.\nHow does a Chapter 7 bankruptcy work?\n\nYour bankruptcy petition, which we prepare for you and file with the Court, begins your bankruptcy case.  Whenever you begin a bankruptcy case, the law requires that you provide the Court with a comprehensive picture of your financial condition.  The information that we include in the petition we prepare for you includes your income, your expenses, a list of your assets, and a list of your creditors and how much you owe them.  As we prepare your petition, we will also discuss with you your finances and provide you advice and counsel.  We continue to advise and support you and communicate with you throughout your bankruptcy case.\nBankruptcy Attorney Las Vegas\n\nBefore you file bankruptcy you must also take a consumer credit counseling course.  Most people choose to take this class online.\n\nPart of the chapter 7 bankruptcy process includes the appointment of a bankruptcy trustee.  The trustee's job is to make sure that your case is handled properly.  One of the trustee's tasks is to review your assets to determine whether any of your assets can be used to pay something to your creditors.  In Nevada, most people can generally keep much if not all of their property in a chapter 7 bankruptcy.  It is very important that your attorney take the time to discuss with you your assets in order to determine what the law protects (exempt assets) and what the law gives to the trustee (non-exempt assets).\n\nOnce you file a chapter 7 bankruptcy petition, you will need to attend a meeting of creditors about 30 days later.  The trustee runs this meeting, and your creditors are invited to attend.  During this meeting the trustee will ask you questions about the information in your petition and make sure you have provided all of the necessary paperwork.\n\nBankruptcy Attorney Las Vegas\n\nIn order to receive your discharge, you will also need to take a second online course, a debtor education course, after we file your bankruptcy petition for you.\n\nAfter you receive your discharge, usually about 3 to 4 months after you file your case, your debts (except for some debts like student loans and some taxes) are no longer enforceable against you.\n\nBankruptcy Attorney Las Vegas\nhttp:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=w5MKe5GOK-g Education"",""title"":"""",""url"":""youtube watch""}"	"?"

4 1 2 Hours "",""body"":""Pin It Now Do you hate cooking I do Unfortunately I like eating and these little things called children that live in my home insist on having dinner each day of the week too What has this equaled for us in the past A lot of eating out which is expensive So I decided to do some research and create a month s worth of freezer to Crockpot meals in one evening 4 1 2 hours to be exact In one Friday night I was able to put together a month s worth of meals and I ll show you how I did it Why Freezer to Crockpot Meals Because their easy Think of it as the lazy woman s monthly cooking Well not lazy just for those of us who hate cooking Plus there is a fresher element to these meals since they are actually cooked for the most part on the day you eat them There is less prep and time involved than if you froze fully cooked meals plus you can fit flattened ziplock bags of ingredients into a freezer much easier than bulky casserole pans What Cooking is Still Involved Most people who hear that I made a month s worth of freezer meals or even planned on doing it asked me what other cooking would be involved Basically you remove the meal you want to eat from the freezer the day before let it defrost in the fridge and then dump it in the Crockpot to cook for the designated amount of time Some meals will need rice and others will need noodles This is where I suggest you get a rice cooker because non instant rice is much cheaper than instant and you don t have to do a thing You can also teach older children to cook pasta and they love getting to help Steam in bag microwave veggies are simple as can be and tossing together a salad is no work at all At most you will need to spend 5 minutes in the kitchen to prepare each nightly meal The Meals Many people avoid Crockpot cooking because they feel it limits them and you can t create meals the whole family will love This isn t true Virtually anything can be cooked in a Crockpot and the meal choices are varied and endless Below is the list of meals I made I created two of each meal except the bacon and feta stuffed chicken for a total of 25 meals I will be linking up the recipes as I get them posted on the site in the coming weeks Meatless Hashbrown Casserole Steak Fajitas Sweet Teriyaki Pork Bacon and Feta Stuffed Chicken Breasts Pepper Steak BBQ Country Style Ribs Cowboy Casserole Adapted from a non Crockpot recipe Chicken Alfredo with Broccoli Spaghetti with Italian Sausage Beef Stroganoff Mexican Salsa Chicken Sausage with Peppers and Onions Roast with Veggies The total cost for these 25 meals including sides and supplies was 275 that is an average of 1 83 per serving for our family of 6 Way less than we would spend eating out and even less than I spent buying meals to cook each night How Do You Do It Creating a month s worth of freezer to Crockpot meals is as simple as filling bags Really Below are the steps I took and that you can take to get it done quickly and efficiently Step 1 Start with a clean kitchen Trying to do this in an already messy kitchen is only going to stress you out Step 2 Have a print out of each recipe with the ingredients and cooking information This is much faster than trying to go back and forth on a computer and you can create your own cookbook of recipes for the future Step 3 Label all your freezer bags with the name of the meal date and cooking instructions Step 4 Cut up all the veggies you will need for the meals It is easier to do this so your eyes only water once Step 5 Start by putting together the meals that require cooked elements For instance the meatless hashbrown casserole is the only meal I made that does not go in a Crockpot and is fully cooked I put that together first so that it would be done and have time to cool while I did the other meals Step 6 Do all meals that require you to prepare or cut meat next I did the pork meals after the cooked meals because they required me to cut the meat Think like steak and ribs were already pre cut Step 7 Finish all remaining meals that are just dump and mix Step 8 Make sure all meals are completely cooled and then stack in the freezer We have a standard size small freezer above a fridge and all 25 meals fit in here The steam in bag veggies for the meals are in the door of the freezer and there is still room for our ice maker Helpful Tips Squeeze out as much air as possible from your bags before closing Squish the ingredients as flat as possible for easier stacking in the fridge If possible by meat that is pre cut It saves a lot of time Clean as you go along It is much easier to hand wash one mixing bowl each time you make a meal than to have 20 dirty mixing bowls when you are done Do not put sliced potatoes into your freezer meals If a recipe requires sliced potatoes like the roast I made add them the day of cooking Sliced potatoes will turn black in the freezer The exception to this is potatoes that are already frozen such as the purchased hashbrowns or tater tots in my meals above Have you ever tried monthly freezer cooking If so how did it go what are your favorite recipes If you have any additional questions feel free to leave them below Kathleen

"",""body"":""The giveaway is now closed but I hope you still enjoy the Nutella Stuffed Cookies After making the first batch of Chocolate Nutella Fudge with Sea Salt last year my family kids grandparents and brother in law included immediately determined it was a must have for each Christmas to be served alongside my husband s great grandmother s spritz butter cookies and my dad s killer ginger cookies Yeah okay twist my arm That fudge set off a cascade of gooey chocolate and hazelnut baking in our house from Chewy Nutella Oatmeal Bars to Nutella Cream Cheese Swirled Blondies It was only a matter of time before the Nutella weaseled its way into the center of my favorite sugar cookie recipe typically made with crumbled Heath Bars When making drop cookies I like to be fairly precise about the size of each cookie so that they cook as evenly as possible No loosey goosey dropping from a spoon in this elf s kitchen For years I have used cookie scoops such as the OXO ones you see in the photos below to dole out an equal amount of batter It makes the process of doling out the dough go quickly and the scoops are fun for little hands to use too You can use the small scoops for bite sized cookies medium scoops for your average sized treats and large scoops for those gargantuan cookies like what you may see in your favorite bakery Of course if you decide to make bite sized cookies that means you get to eat a minimum of three cookies Santa s rule I swear on Rudolph s shiny red nose It s a good thing this rule exists because it is virtually impossible to eat only one of these cookies For details on entering the OXO baking giveaway scroll down You don t want to miss it Again on Rudolph s shiny red nose The recipe Using a 1 teaspoon measure scoop out Nutella and place in small mounds on a cookie sheet lined with parchment paper Place in the freezer for 15 minutes Place an oven rack in the middle position and preheat the oven to 350 degrees F Line 2 large baking sheets with parchment paper In a medium bowl whisk together flour baking powder and salt In a large bowl beat butter and sugar with an electric mixer set on medium speed until the mixture is creamy and fluffy 3 to 5 minutes Beat in eggs one at a time and vanilla extract Turn the mixer to low speed and gradually beat in the flour mixture until it is just combined Using a rubber spatula stir the mixture a few times to make sure all of the flour mixture is incorporated Place 1 3 cup granulated sugar in a small bowl Use 2 tablespoons cookie dough for each cookie Split the piece of dough in half and slightly flatten the bottom half Sprinkle 5 or 6 grains of sea salt on the dough Use a small metal spatula to lift the mounds of Nutella from the baking sheet and lay on the bottom half of cookie dough on top of the salt If the Nutella starts to soften place back in the freezer for a few minutes Cover with the other piece of cookie dough Seal the edges with your fingers Roll the ball in the sugar to coat it and place it on a prepared baking sheet Bake the cookies one sheet a time rotating from front to back halfway through baking They are done when the edges are set and

markets"",""body"":""Think Globally Act Locally Nowhere is that 1970 s saying more relevant than with food Locally grown food are picked at their peak get to your table fresher and chock full of vitamins and minerals and don t waste a lot of the crop and fossil fuels getting from the field to your fork Plus farmer s markets are a great fun gathering place That s one reason they ve been flourishing since the mid 1990s According to the U S Department of Agriculture local growers markets swelled from 1 755 to 4 385 between 1994 and 2006 Chances are there s one in your neck of the woods Yet there is an art to shopping a farmer s market Our friends at FruitandVeggieGuru had a great piece recently on how to get the most out of all the farmer s markets that will be popping up across the land as this seasons produce begins to roll in 1 Find out if all vendors are grower producers Some markets allow sellers with overstock distressed or supermarket rejected produce to unload it cheaply at fruit and vegetable stands While the price may be a deal it s not fresh local produce If that s what you want check with the market manager to determine if that s what you re getting 2 Shop early in the day The early bird gets the apple without the worm The first of season blueberries peaches or Winesap apples often disappear from market tables fast It s a long wait until next season The choice foods you want might disappear if you wait until late in the day The early shopper gets the best choice 3 Let what the season offers guide your meal planning Farmer s market selections come from within 100 or 200 miles Your local climate determines what you ll find on any given day week month But eating in season is a real treat Leafy greens herbs radishes and sprouts come out early and help clear out the winter crops in your system Midsummer you ll have corn berries summer squash and tomatoes and fall will bring apples potatoes onions squash and winter greens Build your menus around what s in season to take full advantage of the earth s bounty You ll begin to know what month it is without looking at a calendar 4 Buy for value but don t balk at prices Some crops like corn green beans herbs squashes cucumbers tomatoes may be less expensive than in the supermarket Other items may be more expensive due to economies of scale expensive heirloom seeds and caring for crops by hand rather than machine But the value is in the just picked flavor and nutrition that s hard to find at MonsterMart 5 Learn the difference between heirloom and mass produced produce Many local farmers use heirloom seeds stock passed down through generations The look colors and flavor of these boutique varieties will be better than crops bred mostly for yield long distance travel and appearance 6 Shop for what s not available in stores When I was a kid I could buy Golden Russet apples at the grocery store No more These beauties are only found now in local farmer s markets and coops plus the ones on my old trees up the hill Same goes for those sweet juicy berries your grandmother remembers from her childhood From peaches to pumpkins you ll find variety and flavor that s not available elsewhere 7 Look for organic growers You ll usually find some offering foods that are grown and processed without artificial ingredients preservatives hormones antibiotics irradiation and most pesticides and fertilizers But don t expect to find the certified organic label Many smaller producers just can t cut the expense of getting certified under the National Organic Program Ask them about how they grow their food A local apple grown without pesticides is usually better than an organic one trucked across the globe 8 Ask when it was picked Sugars in many foods turn to starch soon after picking so find out when they were harvested My wife refuses to eat corn not picked that day Some vendors pick fresh in the morning some the night before because they have to drive for hours to make a 7 am market Avoid anything older 9 Take cash and a reusable shopping bag or shopping cart While larger farmers markets may take debit credit cards most neighborhood markets are cash on the barrelhead deals Your big shopping bag or wagon holds your purchases so you needn t struggle with plastic bags on each finger and can eliminates the bags altogether for a more earth friendly experience 10 Make friends with farmers The people you re buying from are usually the ones who grew the food They can show you their best buys teach you how to buy and prepare new foods like daikon or fennel and sometimes put aside something special for you next time And face to face time with farmers is what it s all about Local is up close and personal building trust community and knowledge of where your food comes from And we can all use a lot more of that Happy Market Day recyclebank rewards people for taking everyday green actions with discounts and deals from local and national businesses. locally grown food are picked at their peak, get to your table fresher and chock full of vitamins and minerals, and don\u2019t waste a lot of the crop and fossil fuels getting from the field to your fork.

"http://www.joyofbaking.com/FruitTart.html"	"8352"	"{""url"":""joyofbaking Fruit Tart html"",""title"":""Fruit Tart Recipe Video "",""body"":""Printer Friendly Page Many years ago I took a week long pastry class at Le Cordon Bleu and one of the first things we made was this Fruit Tart Once I returned home it didn t take long for this dessert to become one of my family s favorite This classic tart has three components a fluted edged sweet pastry crust a luscious pastry cream and glistening rows of fresh fruit It looks enticing whether you use a single fruit or a medley of fruits and berries While the components of this Fruit Tart can be made a day or two in advance it is best enjoyed the day it is assembled The cookie like pastry crust which also goes by the name Pate Sucree has a sweet flavor and a crisp texture that is the perfect vehicle for holding the pastry cream The crust is pre baked and once baked and cooled I like to seal the crust by spreading on a thin layer of apricot glaze This sealing prevents the filling from softening the crust over time The classic filling for a fruit tart is pastry cream or creme patissiere which is a rich thick custard made from a mixture of milk vanilla eggs sugar flour and cornstarch a thickener that is cooked on the stove It can be made a few days in advance so the only thing you need before assembling the tart is a quick whisk to get rid of any lumps Of course the first thing you notice about a fruit tart is the fruit The fruit can be arranged in concentric circles or rows or it can be randomly piled on the cream There are so many fruits to choose from but it is important that the fruit looks and tastes its best While berries with their vibrant colors are always popular other fruits are nice as well Slices of kiwi pineapple melon peaches plums nectarines and mango are some fruits that work well If you like you can glaze the fruit with either an apricot glaze recipe included or red currant jelly for red colored fruits to give the fruit a beautiful shine and it also prevents the fruit from drying out Sweet Pastry Crust In a separate bowl whisk the flour with the salt Place the butter in the bowl of your electric mixer or with a hand mixer and beat until softened Add sugar and beat until light and fluffy Gradually add the beaten egg beating just until incorporated Add the flour mixture all at once and mix just until it forms a ball Flatten the pastry into a disk cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 15 30 minutes or just until firm can place in freezer for about 10 15 minutes Lightly butter and flour or spray with a non stick vegetable flour cooking spray an 8 9 inch 20 23 cm tart pan with a removable bottom Evenly pat the chilled pastry onto the bottom and up the sides of the pan Cover with plastic wrap and place in the freezer for about 15 minutes Meanwhile preheat oven to 400 degrees F 205 degrees C and place rack in center of oven Lightly prick bottom of pastry crust with the tines of a fork this will prevent the dough from puffing up as it bakes Place tart pan on a larger baking pan and bake crust for 5 minutes Reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees F 180 degrees C and continue to bake the crust for about 15 minutes or until dry and lightly golden brown Remove from oven and place on a wire rack to cool completely before filling Can be covered and stored for a few days Pastry Cream In a medium sized heatproof bowl mix the sugar and egg yolks together Do let the mixture sit too long or you will get pieces of egg forming Sift the flour and cornstarch corn flour together and then add to the egg mixture mixing until you get a smooth paste Meanwhile in a saucepan bring the milk and vanilla bean just to boiling just until milk starts to foam up Remove from heat and add slowly to egg mixture whisking constantly to prevent curdling If you get a few pieces of egg curdling in the mixture pour through a strainer Remove vanilla bean scrape out seeds and add the seeds to the egg mixture The vanilla bean can be washed and dried and placed in your sugar bowl to give the sugar a vanilla flavor Then pour the egg mixture into a medium saucepan and cook over medium heat until boiling whisking constantly When it boils whisk mixture constantly for another 30 60 seconds until it becomes thick Remove from heat and immediately whisk in the liqueur if using Stir in vanilla extract is using instead of a vanilla bean Pour into a clean bowl and immediately cover the surface with plastic wrap to prevent a crust from forming Cool to room temperature If not using right away refrigerate until needed up to 3 days Beat or whisk before using to get rid of any lumps that may have formed Apricot Glaze Heat the apricot jam or preserves and water in a small saucepan over medium heat until liquid melted Can also heat in the microwave Remove from heat and strain the jam through a fine strainer to remove any fruit lumps To Assemble Tart To remove the tart from the fluted sides of the pan place your hand under the pan touching only the removable bottom not the sides Gently push the tart straight up away from the sides The fluted tart ring will fall away and slide down your arm If you want to remove the bottom of the pan run a knife or thin metal spatula between the crust and metal bottom then slide the tart onto your platter Spread a thin layer of apricot glaze over the bottom and sides of the baked tart shell to prevent the crust from getting soggy Let the glaze dry about 20 minutes Then spread the pastry cream onto the bottom of the tart shell Place fruit randomly on top of cream or in concentric overlapping circles starting at the outside edge After arranging the fruit rewarm the glaze if using and gently brush a light coat on the fruit If not serving immediately refrigerate but bring to room temperature before serving This fruit tart is best eaten the same day as it is assembled Cover and refrigerate any leftovers Serves about 6 8 people Sources

ban on the sale of tobacco to anyone who can t flash a licence at the cashier Good news for smokers Le Grand reckons said licence should cost only 10 Bad news he wants to make the application process as deliberately complex as possible You d have to fill out a lengthy form attaching a photograph proof of age and a fee and send it all to a central Smoker s Permit processing centre and wait for your licence to come back by which point let s face it you would have probably died Oh and the licence expires after a year so you have to apply all over again each time it runs out Why leave it there Why not make it expire every 24 hours so you have to reapply each morning Or include a Sudoku on the application form Or force the tobacco companies to sell cigarettes inside complicated Japanese puzzle boxes Or change the name of the brands each week without publicising the change while simultaneously making it illegal for a shop to sell you anything you haven t asked for by name so you have to stand at the counter fishing for codewords for an hour Or here s a good one Julian make it a requirement for smokers to walk around with a broomhandle stuck through their sleeves running behind the neck so their arms are permanently splayed out like a scarecrow s To spark up under those conditions they d have to work together in pairs flailing around in the outdoor smoking area like something out of It s a Knockout His paper incidentally also proposes incentives for large companies to provide a daily exercise hour for staff Welcome to your future life having struggled into work suffering withdrawal pangs because today s smoking licence didn t arrive in the post you re forced to spend 60 minutes doing squat thrusts in the car park And each time you start crying a man in a helmet comes round to gently remind you that it s all for your own good Through a loudhailer If that sounds like a nightmare don t worry you can still wriggle out of the squat thrusts provided you re carrying a valid Laziness Licence whose application process involves climbing a ladder to reach the forms stored at the top of a 200ft crane ticking 900 boxes with a 7kg pencil and finally posting it into a motorised mailbox that persistently runs away from you at speeds of up to 25mph In other words you still have freedom of choice Provided you re carrying a valid Freedom of Choice Permit that is Getting your hands on a Freedom of Choice Permit is pretty straightforward The application form requires only your name and signature Admittedly you have to deliver it in person to the Freedom of Choice Licensing Agency which is open only between 4 15am and 4 18am and is based in an unmarked office in the Falklands but nevertheless thousands have already applied if the queues are anything to go by The current waiting time is a mere nine weeks although you d be advised to get there early and guard your place in line because there have been reports of disturbances Anyway once you ve got your Freedom of Choice Permit you re free to do as you please within reason provided you notify the Central Scrutiniser six days in advance of any unapproved activity quoting your 96 digit Freedom of Choice Permit code in full which isn t printed anywhere on the permit itself but is given to you once and only once whispered quickly into your ear at the desk in the Falklands by a man standing beneath a loudspeaker barking out other numbers at random The permit itself incidentally is shaped like a broomhandle and is designed to be threaded through your sleeves at all times If you couldn t be bothered with all that you will just have to do as you re told which isn t that bad to be honest There s a compulsory exercise hour or five and an approved list of foodstuffs but that s about it You will still have at least 10 minutes a day to do as you please although we ve just banned violent videogames which are bad for your head and there are one or two ideologies we d rather you didn t discuss with friends or on the internet which is why we re not issuing any Freedom of Speech Permits for the time being although if you d like to be notified when they re available simply book yourself into one of our underground holding pens and remain there until your name is called or not called or time itself comes to an end Whichever takes the longest Once upon a time in between

It would be better to live under robber barons than under omnipotent moral busybodies The robber baron s cruelty may sometimes sleep his cupidity may at some point be satiated but those who torment us for our own good will torment us without end for they do so with the approval of their own conscience You can nod your head in agreement if you like Once you ve got your Nodding Permit Don t want you

effort"",""body"":""We all like to look nice We do Our concept of what constitutes nice might differ but at the end of the day when you feel like you look your best you feel good about yourself I witter on a lot about dressing up and how no one makes an effort anymore but the truth is it s all too easy NOT to make an effort No one really minds if you just fling on a jumper over jeans and trainers when you re just popping to the Post Office Supermarket doing the School run or even going to the Pub We all live varied and busy lives we don t often have domestic help and most of us like an extra half an hour in bed in the morning None of these things are conducive to perfectly coiffed pin curls and elegantly manicured red nails but it IS possible to look groomed in a hurry even if you re only going to the shop Trust me I don t get up any earlier than I have to These are my top tips for minimal effort glamour They probably require a little thought but they re not hard if they were I wouldn t do them Natural nails File them into a nice shape keep them a sensible length a maximum of half a centimetre over your finger tip and paint them a neutral or clear shade Your nails will look nice and glossy breakage will be minimised and they can be chipped to hell but no one will know unless they look really closely Manageable Hair This is different for everyone and only you know how much effort you can be prepared to make I can be bothered to set my hair twice a week and spend 10 minutes before bed putting it back in pin curls so it stays curly If you can t don t try this hair do I also work from home so if I want to spend all day in curlers that s fine It might not cut it in the office Wear it longer so you can put it in a bun cut in a fringe wear it short and deliberately tousled or get a perm Whatever is manageable for you your hair and your lifestyle When your pin curls fall flat you couldn t be bothered to set it last night you ve got no time to brush it out or it s in dire need of a wash it s always handy to perfect 2 or 3 hair styles and have some tips and tricks to freshen it up A few suggestions they might not work with all hair styles types so play around A Hat I tuck mine under a beret and roll the fringe It takes about 2 minutes and everyone thinks I have lovely hair This also works with no time to brush out curls Just unpin the front few and cover the rest with a hat A Hair Rat Roll your hair around it into a long bun and stick in a few pins Speedy and looks good when your curls have fallen flat If you ve a bit more time you can roll your fringe or just twist the sides and stick in some combs This looks elegant and grown up Dry Shampoo A Hair band Spray on some dry shampoo brush it out then scrape all your hair back into a high bouncy ponytail or turn it into an Audrey Hepburn style high bun with a bit of backcombing and some grips A scarf wrap it round your head Rosie the Riveter style or fold it into a hair band and tie it on top of your head roll your fringe back into a quiff and tie the back in a pony tail for a cute rockabilly look Clothes Don t leave choosing what to wear until the morning especially if you have an early start You don t need to lay it all out but at least check that your essentials are clean and have a few outfits that you can wear if all else fails That way you won t end up in a screwed up blouse with custard down the front just because everything is still wet in the machine My fall back outfits are a couple of black jersey dresses I know if they re clean I ll be able to cobble together some kind of outfit by adding a cardigan and shoes In the winter it s probably best to try and be a bit organised about things like tights and stockings too or have fall back trousers My top tip is to take the time to dry things flat Stretch your trousers and skirts out as straight as you can before you hang them on the line and smooth down collars and turn ups Fold and hang them as smooth as you can too I hardly ever iron anything apart from a couple of cotton 50s summer dresses Accessories It s amazing the psychological impact of a few accessories It s like peoples brains fill in the gaps and decide you must have made a massive effort to pin that brooch on your coat lapel put in a pair of earrings tie a scarf round your neck pick up some gloves Keep things like shoes in good clean condition If you don t have time to remove mud from them then wear another pair until you do Scruffy shoes can make the rest of you look scruffy Most people won t notice your shoes UNLESS you go out with them covered in mud They don t have to be polished to a high shine but don t wear them dirty Perfect Minimal Make Up On an ideal morning we ll all spend several hours in front of our vanity Sipping earl grey tea from vintage china while we perfect a leisurely toilet ably assisted by bluebirds and squirrels from the nearby forest In reality I at least never get up when my alarm goes off I sit grumpily in bed for half an hour before getting up in a panic knowing I have to be out of the door in 20 minutes It s ok I can put a hat over my pin curls I know my nails are already neat and I ve checked my emergency fall back clothes are clean so I can leap into a dress stockings and little cardigan Make up however you can t do in advance I can do a full face of make up in under 10 minutes Foundation concealer bit of blusher Eyeliner mascara eyebrow pencil and a slick of red lippy If I m really pushed for time I skip the eyeliner And if I m really really pushed then I ll wear a neutral lipstick I NEVER skip the eyebrow pencil Well groomed brows make your face look finished If you already have dark eyebrows you might just need to tidy them with clear mascara or vaseline If you have perfect skin you can probably skip foundation and I hate you The key is knowing the minimal elements you can add to your face to give it a polished finish in the time you have remaining Multi purpose products like blusher lipsticks and full coverage powder foundations can save time Do try not to end up doing full make up on the train though Lipstick and a touch of powder is one thing but tweezing your eyebrows in public is probably a step too far other people have to watch you Last minute cheats Shhh you ll have to pretend I never mentioned any of these Fix the bits people can see The corner shop is a minute and a halfs walk away you re watching TV in your pyjamas Do we really want to do full make up and hair to go and buy milk In winter a smart coat is a life saver Fling it over any old thing and run to the shop but PLEASE don t go to the shop in your bunny print pyjamas it s just rude You must have a pair of trousers to fling on Wearing curlers A beret will fit over the lot or just swap the front couple for pin curls and let them poke out of the front No make up A bit of concealer and a light stain of red lipstick will convince casual observers that you re fully made up Dab a bit of lipstick on your cheeks and rub it in for last minute blusher Roll on Summer when we can add a huge pair of sunglasses without looking like we re avoiding the paparazzi That s all I can think of for now When ever I do these kind of posts someone else always comes up with the most amazing tip that I forgot to mention so Do you have any tips for looking good in a hurry

"",""body"":""NINE STARS OUR HIGHEST RANKING Right out of the box there seemed to be something a bit different about our new Apollo Extreme Starter Kit The components appeared to be a little larger than what we had been used to seeing Measuring one of the two lithium ion cigarette style batteries confirmed our first impression At 3\u215c inches in length the Apollo Extreme is about a half inch longer than most electronic cigarette batteries Double end capped and plugged to maintain freshness the cartridge atomizers are longer as well measuring 1\u215d inches as opposed to the standard 1\u00bc inches In addition to the two batteries and five cartridge atomizers the Apollo Extreme Starter Kit includes the user manual a USB charger an AC wall adaptor and a car charger adaptor an accessory that is not often included in starter kits Currently priced at five for 15 00 Apollo Extreme cartridge atomizers are available in Tobacco Menthol Vanilla Coffee and Cherry flavors in your choice of High Medium Low and Zero Nicotine levels Order 11 or more packs for bulk pricing of 5 cartridge atomizers for 12 50 We next screwed a Tobacco High cartridge atomizer onto the battery and took a good drag We were rewarded with satisfying tobacco flavor and exhaled an expansive plume of beautiful white vapor So far So good A second drag produced the same result a rich tobacco flavor and an impressive white vapor cloud Drawing on the Apollo was quiet and easy There were no crackling or popping sounds an unfortunate quality we have come to associate with lesser e cigarette brands Pleased with our first Apollo Electronic Cigarette experience we set one of the batteries to charge and decided to resume our testing the next day The following day we unplugged our now fully charged battery and screwed it onto another Tobacco High cartridge atomizer We took our first drag and were once again well pleased with the resulting flavor and vapor Apollo Extreme was proving to be a new smoking pleasure While the Apollo Extreme excels in many ways perhaps the most remarkable thing about it is the price Editor Top 5 Electronic Cigarettes Handling the Apollo Extreme one cannot help but notice that the slightly larger and heavier components are well designed and crafted The excellent fit and finish are complimented by long lasting cartridge atomizers equal to about a pack and a half of cigarettes and superior battery life The more we smoked our Apollo e cigarette the better we liked it While the Apollo Extreme excels in many ways perhaps the most remarkable thing about it is the price At 54 95 it is priced substantially lower than comparably equipped starter kits of lesser quality and provides a superior value that is difficult to beat Additionally and unlike most electronic cigarette retailers Apollo owns its own factories and labs Investment in the research and development of e cigarette technology is yet another reason to believe that one you are buying from Apollo you are purchasing a state of the art product from a company that stands behind its products if you are a one pack a day or more smoker interested in making the switch to electric we could hardly think of a better choice than Apollo Extreme It gets the job done beautifully it s a joy to smoke and it s inexpensive Editor Top 5 Electronic Cigarettes We tried to think of downsides to the Apollo Extreme and came up with only one possibility It is slightly larger than the average electronic cigarette about 4 measuring 4\u215e fully assembled It is similar in size and weight to Green Smoke when using the longer of the two supplied batteries and the new FlavorMax cartridge atomizers The positives associated with the larger size are however substantial The 3\u215c 280mAh battery will last longer than a standard cigarette style battery and the larger cartridge atomizer provides about a pack and a half worth of smoking with superior vapor volume If you are a social smoker making the switch to e cigarettes the Apollo Extreme may not be the right choice for you But if you are a one pack a day or more smoker interested in making the switch to electric we could hardly think of a better choice than Apollo Extreme It gets the job done beautifully it s a joy to smoke and it s inexpensive We estimated that including the starter kit purchase the cost to maintain a one pack per day cigarette habit using Apollo Extreme was only 762 45 annually or 63 54 per month or 14 66 per week or only 2 09 per day We found Apollo Extreme to be a superior value when compared to the cost of traditional cigarettes and the same one pack per day habit at 6 00 per pack or 2190 00 per year or 182 50 per month or 42 12 per week or 6 00 per day The annual savings for an Apollo Extreme smoker is 1427 55 In summary we found Apollo Extreme Starter Kit at 54 95 to be a superior value Shipping is free and in addition to the one year limited warranty it includes a 30 day money back guarantee big pluses in our book These factors and others account for Apollo Extreme earning our highest ranking as the best electronic cigarette currently available FINAL JUDGMENT Apollo Extreme has earned 9 STARS and OUR HIGHEST RECOMMENDATION in summary, we found apollo extreme starter kit at $54.95 to be a superior value. shipping is free, and in addition to the one-year limited warranty, it includes a 30-day, money-back guarantee - big pluses in our book. these factors and others account for apollo extreme earning our highest-ranking as the best electronic cigarette currently available.""}"	"?"

further proof were needed just ask the millions around the world who every day escape into their vegetable patches and rose beds to tend to the delicate needs of their personal flora However just like any pursuit gardening has its competitive side For these hardcore growers gardening isn t just about tempting some tasty potatoes out of the ground Instead they are locked in a desperate race to produce the largest vegetables the world has ever seen When it comes to the world s biggest melons you can forget about cantaloupes ripe juicy watermelons are king But for these people a watermelon is not a watermelon unless it weighs at least 100lbs and that s a small one Welcome to the world of giant melons where size definitely does matter We can think of plenty of individuals who d like to own or get their hands on a couple of these 7 2008 Maryland Watermelon 98lb Image Bjornmeansbear As they say the lady loves the melons At 98lb this melon grown in Manchester Maryland looks huge it s as big as a sheep However you ain t seen nothing yet this is barely a sprat when it comes to real titan melons While you re salivating over those thoughts consider the fact that consisting of 92 water and 6 sugar watermelon is actually a delicious low calorie snack When it comes in giant size there s simply all the more to go around Watermelon is a great source of Vitamin C but take heed many of the nutrients in watermelons are actually locked up in the white inner rind so don t throw away your melon until you re done with it The fruit s vitamin content can provide protection from cancer while the high potassium levels can help to prevent cramps Watermelon is great on its own in a salad or as an ingredient in your cocktails non alcoholic or otherwise In China they re even stir fried 6

watermelon at the North Carolina state fair 2006 Enough to make anybody proud Using closely guarded techniques and pure breed seeds descended from only the most gargantuan of watermelons growers are able to cultivate melons weighing well over 200lbs that s more than your average man During the summer months their proud owners transport and display them all over the country at fairs and vegetable exhibitions competing against fellow melon lovers at events such as the Watermelon Olympics a celebration of all things melon 5 1930 World Record Watermelon 1603 4lb Image Giant Watermelons Indeed by as early the 1920s the 150lb North Carolina melon had been bettered and in 1930 alone the world record was broken three times The first contender was one AB Turner pictured above before he lost the record to OD Middlebrooks s entry which weighed in at 4lb heavier than Turner s Nevertheless you can see from Mr Turner s face that he s more than happy to be spending time with his baby AB Turner isn t the only record breaker to hail from the little town of Hope Arkansas this is one town that hoped for watermelon Only twice since 1930 has the record left Hope s community of melon growers and the town folk are so attached to their beloved giant melons that they consider out of town challenger vegetables to be plain wrong 4 1935 World Record Watermelon 195lb Image Ellen Ficklen www watermelontimes com While 1930 might have been a turbulent year for melons 1935 set in a period of calm when Arnold Melvin and OD Middlebrooks set a world record that would last for 44 years Naturally they were Hope locals living in Patmos 9 miles south of the town and one can imagine they knew exactly what to do with their melon Image Giant Watermelons Warm sunshine is the perfect condition for cultivating giant melons and the growers cultivar of choice is the Carolina Cross which can range in size from a mere 15lbs to well over 200lbs They are freely available so why not give it a go yourself and pray for the right meteorological conditions You can buy champion seeds direct from Hope s growers and with a heritage like that you could have your own bumper melons Alternatively you could make your way to Hope s melon festival and dig in or you could set about procuring some of the prize contenders which failed to make the grade Scrumptious 3 1979 World Record Watermelon 200lb

own records In 1985 Jason L Bright broke the record set by his father and grandfather with an amazing 260lb melon monster In the decades since then the melons haven t got much bigger The summer of 2005 brought a severe drought to many parts of the US causing farmers much grief but one notable exception was the melon farmers as we ll see The drought enabled them to control the moisture delivered to their melons much more closely allowing for a bumper crop of massive melons Easy boys 1 2005 World Record Watermelon 268 8lb Image giantwatermelons com Recognise these two On Saturday September 3rd

Cohen Meredith Cutler Deborah Coulter Bellow is an edited excerpt from Hydrocolloid Printing A Novel Platform for Customized Food Production More examples and Materials can be found on the Fab Home Website Impact of Food SFF Few things are as natively intertwined with humanity as food which is essential to biological and social life Not only does food support life and underpin social relations but it also accounts for a substantial part of our economy As of 2008 Americans spent 1 02 trillion annually on food i e 9 6 of the nation s combined disposable personal incomes Solid Freeform Fabrication SFF has the potential to leverage its core strengths e g geometric complexity automated fabrication and make its mark on the culinary realm by transforming the way we produce and experience food Technological innovations are necessary however before these visions can be realized In addition to lowering barriers to SFF such as cost of the machine materials must be developed to feasibly enable a wide range of foods to be produced on SFF platforms Impact on Culinary Professionals Overview Food SFF would benefit the professional culinary domain primarily in two respects by lending new artistic capabilities to the fine dining domain and also by extending mass customization capabilities to the industrial culinary sector Impact on Culinary Professionals Fine Dining Fine dining chefs are continually developing new innovative techniques and seeking the enabling technologies that will help them push the boundaries of culinary art They innovate by harnessing non traditional ingredients such as hydrocolloids and by employing new tools pulled straight from the scientific community the result is culinary magic including flavored gelatin spheres with liquid centers sauce foams hot liquid deserts with flash frozen shells syringe extrudable meats and much more SFF promises to be the next important enabling technology in the fine dining realm SFF delivers new possibilities by lending this faction of culinary artists one of SFF s core capabilities fabrication of multi material objects with high geometric complexity As the barriers fall e g SFF machine prices have reduced nearly an order of magnitude in the last decade and non traditional ingredients gain credibility in the fine dining world e g hydrocolloids the question is not whether SFF will play an important role in the future of food but rather in what ways will it do so Examples of potential future applications include cakes with complex embedded 3D letters such that upon slicing the cake a message is revealed Or even a prime rib with a hidden message Perhaps an on demand customizable menu in which the dish is prepared in any 3D shape that the diner desires the diner can co create with the culinary artist in real time Impact on Culinary Professionals Industrial Production The second way in which SFF could benefit the professional culinary community is by enabling mass customization in the industrial culinary sector Today industrial food producers rely heavily on high throughput processes such as molding extrusion and die cutting These processes however are not amenable to mass customization i e the use of flexible manufacturing techniques to produce custom output in a low unit cost fashion Molding extrusion and die cutting each require substantial custom tooling and consequently producing custom output for low quantity runs is simply unfeasible This is precisely where SFF s inherent strengths can be leveraged producing food with custom complex geometries while maintaining cost effectiveness The cost effectiveness is enabled by the fact that SFF does not require custom tooling or extensive manual labor One potential future application is custom production of edible giveaways for example as marketing collateral for small corporate events Currently the cost of custom tooling prohibits low quantity custom production runs but with a flexible culinary production platform like SFF such production runs would be feasible Impact in the Home Overview Culinary professionals are more primed to adopt SFF than are homeowners however the implications for laypeople are even more profound The effect on laypeople is essentially twofold increasing productivity and injecting knowledge Impact in the Home Productivity Currently the average American spends more than 30 minutes per day preparing food according to USDA economists If food SFF were brought to the set and forget state requiring minimal human labor the average person could possibly realize time savings of 150 hours per year 3 8 workweeks per year Impact in the Home Injecting Knowledge The second way that food SFF could impact laypeople is by abstracting culinary knowledge and injecting it directly into the home The idea of abstracting knowledge is nothing new When chefs create new dishes and then write recipes they are effectively abstracting their knowledge and distilling it into a prescription for others to reproduce their work Nevertheless just like the skills a musician needs to effectively play a song from sheet music a recipe follower still needs non trivial skills to execute a recipe It is not only in the abstraction of knowledge but also in the execution of the prescription that SFF could have tremendous impact Just as MIDI software can offload musical skill by taking in digital sheet music and directly creating sound the SFF system could directly inject the skills necessary to follow a recipe end to end Laypeople don t have to know the first thing about musical notation valve key fret fingering or tonal theory to be able to utilize a stereo system to deliver a distilled version of a live musical performance directly into their home Likewise a layperson would not necessarily need to possess even basic culinary skills to employ an SFF system to create geometrically complex multi material food items Culinary knowledge and artistic skill of world renowned chefs can be abstracted to a 3D fabrication file and then used by laypeople to reproduce famous chefs work in the home Also expert knowledge of the world s leading nutritionists can be abstracted and encoded in 3D fabrication files to help laypeople eat more healthily without necessarily having to learn healthy cooking techniques or even understand nutritional principles such as caloric intake and protein balance SFF systems could even go one step further and deliver customized solutions SFF s core strength to each user that incorporate the individualized nature of nutritional needs For example a layperson may soon be able to upload a report of their daily activity from a pedometer and digital food log and the SFF system could use expert knowledge to print them a meal that fulfills their particular nutritional needs for the day While experts can currently offer advice on how to balance a nutritional program their influence falls short of delivering the end to end solution that only SFF system can provide from personalized design through fabrication Lipton J I Arnold D Nigl F Lopez N Cohen D L Noren Nils Lipson H 2010 Multi Material

know that I got a new camera this weekend There is always a period of adjustment with a new piece of tech and I only know what about half of the buttons do But I know how to take a photo with it so I thought I would make one of my favorite meals to try it out Mashed potato pizza is one of those things that you might think is weird or gross when you hear it but I promise it is really good It turns out that mashed potatoes and pizza are made to be together This was one of the best pizzas I ve ever had There is no tomato on this pizza In its place is a thick layer of garlicky buttery mashed potatoes I actually had mashed potato pizza for the first time in New Haven at a place called Bar but I ve sort of made the recipe my own and I think I might be able to give them a run for their money Mashed Potato Pizza The dough This makes two pizzas From Alton Brown s recipe 4 Cups bread flour 4 Tablespoons sugar 2 Tablespoons Kosher salt I probably used 1 3 4 The original is a bit salty 2 Tablespoons olive oil 2 Teaspoons active dry yeast 1 1 2 Cups lukewarm water Flour for dusting the pizza peel or baking sheet Olive oil for rising the dough Pizza 4 large potatoes enough mashed potatoes for 2 pizzas 4 cloves garlic 1 2 stick butter 1 2 cup milk or cream 3 Tablespoons olive oil 8 ounces of bacon per pizza 10 ounces mozzarella per pizza Broccoli Anything else that fits your fancy Helpful Equipment Pizza stone and peel Let s make the dough first Pizza dough is something that really needs to rest for a good amount of time to mature in flavor and get nice and elastic I typically like to make mine the day before I intend to cook To start combine the yeast salt sugar olive oil and water in a bowl Yeast soup Add your flour and bring all of the dough into a ball When it looks like the below you can start kneading it If you have a fancy mixer you can beat it with the paddle attachment for 10 minutes and save yourself a workout Before a 10 minute knead If like me you rely on pure brute strength to make awesome pizza then you ll need to knead this dough for at least ten minutes but probably closer to 15 Eventually it will become very smooth Then it is time to rise Pour a bit of olive oil in your bowl and lightly coat your ball of dough This will make sure it doesn t dry out Let it rise at room temperature for two hours This is active dough After the rise you can punch it down and cut it into two balls If you must you can use them right away but they will be much better if you let them chill in the fridge for at least a day They can keep for a few days though if you coat them in a bit of olive oil If you do put them in the fridge let them rise at room temperature for an hour before using them Now we need to make the toppings for this guy I m assuming you know how to make bacon crispy is better for this recipe You also probably know how to make mashed potatoes but if not just cut up the potatoes into cubes and boil them in lightly salted water for about 10 minutes until they fall apart when poked with a fork Then mash them up with the garlic cream or milk and butter I actually like mine a bit on the chunky side It gives the pizza a good texture Good ingredients Next preheat the oven to 450 degrees with a baking stone in it Forming a pizza takes a bit of practice If it is your first time go slow and be patient The dough is very forgiving if you made it correctly It will be very elastic Take a ball and roll it out into a circle With light pressure start working it from the inside out Once you feel comfortable feel free to pick it up and stretch it over your knuckles a bit It shouldn t rip if you keep it moving by lightly rotating it around your hand If you are feeling brave you can give it a toss Had a little photography help on this one Once you have a rough circle that is the size you want and the thickness that you want slap it on a pizza peel that has been dusted with corn meal or flour If you don t have a peel you can use a baking sheet The sheet just makes it a bit harder to slide it into the oven I used one for years though before I got a peel Feel free to make a decorative crust or just leave it flat Whatever makes you happy No need to do a crust but they are pretty easy Sprinkle a bit of olive oil over your dough Since we aren t using a sauce we need to add a bit of moisture on the bottom A sprinkle of oil Then lump on your mashed potatoes No need to spread them out evenly or anything They will flatten out while baking Also don t be stingy This is the base of the pie No need to go light on the potatoes Next add your bacon Sweet sweet bacon I mean come on Then add your grated mozzarella Feel free to sprinkle on some dried basil pepper and salt at this point also Ready for an oven Carefully slide the pizza into the oven Bake for 15 minutes Try not to drool on the oven door Longest 15 minutes of my life Take out your pizza and the crust should be crispy and great The cheese should be lightly browned Wait a few minutes slice and eat a piece right away A little slice of Heaven A made a second pizza with broccoli and some cheddar on top I think it was even better than the first Healthy I cannot express how good this recipe is If you like pizza you will love this If you don t like pizza then you will probably still like this If you don t then I m not sure we can be friends If you liked this post I would love it if you used the below links to share it with others Everyone should try this guy creamy mashed potato pizza is one of my favorite recipes. you can top it

requests and comments about these Scary Apples I ve decided to rerun them for this year s Halloween Kind of a greatest hits right Enjoy And Boo Full confession When I was about 4 or 5 years old I was so utterly terrified of Halloween that I once ran from the dinner table to the bedroom where I locked myself inside it for 20 minutes while Trick or Treaters came to the front door of the house I m not sure why I did that exactly as I wasn t normally a timid or shy child I think my dramatic exit had more to do with the fact that I enjoyed that sense of fright darkness and mystery that rolls around every October I like to be scared when I know nothing bad will actually happen This explains my interest in fright nights scary movies haunted houses macabre scenarios you name it I think there s a part of all of us that likes that thrill why else would we visit haunted houses watch slasher films and listen to Paris Hilton songs and videos Not that I ve done the latter Even that s too scary for me When I mentioned to Adam that I wanted to do my first Halloween blog post about a cocktail I tried he quickly informed me that it would neither be a exciting b deep enough or c have enough pizazz What s so exciting about a cocktail all by itself he asked I could see his point as there are tons of others who focus on spirits and do a much better job Besides this drink wasn t anything exciting or thrilling but perfect for the grown ups at any Halloween party Give me a few minutes and I ll help you out said Adam Wow Was my drink really that lackluster that it needed help Apparently so He grabbed his car keys ran to the store came back but not before making a detour to the front yard where he began tugging at one of the trees My partner isn t a man of a thousand words which must be why we re a great match but sometimes stoic and methodical He was up to something I could tell but I didn t quite know what When he returned to the kitchen he ransacked his baking shelf took out the candy thermometer a sheet pan and began his kitchen alchemy What happened next was pure magic I walked back into the kitchen to find the most beautiful candied apples before me Black glossy cinnamon scented candied glass enveloped small apples twigs became their handles and a few shockingly red candied apples only made their black counterparts more ominous It was halloween on a silpat a spooky forest that completed my cocktail I had no choice but to have him bundle up the apples head to the studio with me where I knew exactly how I wanted to photograph them They joined my new favorite black wine goblets from Juliska in an eery still life that still gives me the chills when I look at it Only this time there s no need to lock myself in my bedroom Red Black Candy Apples 8 10 medium sized apples8 10 wooden twigs twimmed3 cups granulated sugar1 2 cup light corn syrup1 cup of waterseveral drops of cinnamon flavored oil1 4 teaspoon of red food coloring1 4 teaspoon of black food coloringClean and dry the apples Try to remove as much of the wax as possible If you purchase them from your local farmer s market then chances are they have not been treated with the food grade wax that makes then shine Remove any stems or leaves and insert a twig into the end of each apple To facilitate easier twig entry you can carefully sharpen the end of the twig or use a candy stick to create a guide hole Set apples aside Heat and stir sugar corn syrup and water in a saucepan until sugar has dissolved Boil until the syrup reaches 300 degrees on a candy thermometer Don t go over 310 degrees or your candy burns and then you ll be sad Remove from heat and stir in flavored oil and food coloring Dip one apple completely in the syrup and swirl it so that it becomes coated with the melted sugar candy Hold the apple above the saucepan to drain off excess Place apple with the stick facing up onto a baking sheet that s greased or lined with a silpat Repeat the process with the remaining apples If your syrup thickens or cools too much simply reheat briefly before proceeding Let the apples cool completely before serving A note about the black apples Lighter colored apples Granny Smith Golden Delicious work well in making the red appear bright and glassy darker apples like red delicious help the black candy appear as dark as possible Muy spooky Also Adam made one batch with red food coloring and after he had a few red apples he reheated the candy mixture and added black food coloring Adding black to red will make it darker He repeated the dipping process Black food coloring can be found online or at specialty baking stores Matt s Winter Cocktail I only call this winter because it has the flavors of pomegranate apple and pear Other than that it s really just a sweet excuse to get drunk The pinch of pumpkin pie spice in the drink gives it a holiday flair but it s subtle You can use dry ice to make it spooooky if you make a large batch of it but I don t recommend putting dry ice into an individual glass if you want to keep your lips Serves 2 2 oz Pama Pomegranate Liqueur2 oz Pear Vodka4 oz Apple Cider or Juicetiniest teensiest pinch of Pumpin Pie Spice Add ingredients and crushed ice to a shaker and blend well Empty drink and ice into a glass and get your drunk on Tagged as AdamCPearson Candy Apples Cher would love this Halloween Juliska rocks

operation"",""body"":""Every day that Meredith Moore lives makes medical history By all rights she should have succumbed to Stage 3 pancreatic cancer in 2011 after two years of aggressive chemo and radiation therapy But Moore a determined mother of two was not nearly ready to say good bye The former businesswoman searched out the best doctors in the country No one would operate on her they all said it was too dangerous given the location of her tumor and the proximity to major arteries and blood vessels Then she remembered a newspaper article someone had given her after her dad died from pancreatic cancer about an extraordinary New York transplant surgeon who took on difficult cases though not pancreatic cancer QUEENS TEEN LAUNCHES AMBITIOUS BID TO RAISE FUNDS FOR BLOOD CANCER RESEARCH I couldn t get him out of my head she recalled thinking Maybe that guy that guy could help me That guy turned out to be Dr Tomoaki Kato the chief of abdominal organ transplants at New York Presbyterian Hospital Columbia University Medical Center Kato is a world renowned pioneer in a rare and cutting edge field known as ex vivo resection a procedure in which surgeons take out a patient s organs and operate on them to remove tumors that cannot be treated any other way and then sew the organs back in Kato has done more than two dozen such surgeries involving the removal of one or two organs But he has only done three extreme surgeries the kind he would attempt with Moore which entailed removing six abdominal organs to cut out the tumor that was wrapped around the blood vessels and to make sure no invisible cancer cells are lurking nearby It is a brutal assault on the body Without a pancreas Moore would become an instant diabetic Her hospital stay would be a month and full recovery would take a year including a feeding tube an initially reluctant Kato explained ROGER EBERT DEAD AT 70 PULITZER PRIZE WINNING FILM CRITIC LOSES LONG BATTLE WITH CANCER After reviewing her records examining her in person and conferring with 20 to 30 colleagues in the hospital s tumor council Kato told Moore and her devoted husband Dan that he would take her case She would become the first person in the world to undergo this multi organ megasurgery for pancreatic cancer one of the fastest moving and deadliest of all cancers Kato told Moore she had a 70 chance of surviving the postoperative period Moore knew she had a 100 chance of dying if she didn t take the chance It was like standing at the edge of a cliff with a cancer that was a gun to my head said Moore who grew up in Monroe Orange County married her high school sweetheart and now lives outside Boston with the couple s two kids Gretchen 13 and Nathan 11 Choking back tears she added If this meant I could be here to see my daughter get through middle school and my son grow up I decided to jump On June 5 2011 in a 20 hour operation involving three choreographed rotating teams of surgeons Kato removed Moore s pancreas and the deadly tumor buried deep within it The surgeons also took out her stomach spleen gallbladder liver and parts of her intestines The pancreas stomach and spleen were discarded Parts of her small and large intestines and her entire liver once they were examined and it was determined that cancer had not spread there were sewn back in NUMBER OF CANCER SURVIVORS ON THE RISE STUDY For local advanced inoperable pancreatic cancer the average survival time is one to two years with the best available chemotherapy explained Kato a soft spoken and humble man whom Esquire magazine in 2010 called one of 16 geniuses who give us hope So far she has survived almost two additional years with no obvious recurrence We cannot draw any conclusions from the success of one case but I am extremely happy for her that she came this far All of our fingers are crossed Asked if he could imagine Moore s surgery becoming routine one day Kato said I would really love to see that but I can t really picture it yet But the concept of ex vivo technique may become incorporated as a part of standard care at some point It has not been an easy road but Moore 45 has no regrets Less than a year after the surgery she was able to walk more than 2 miles with friends and drive a car again She has been on family vacations including walking the top rim of the Grand Canyon Although not able yet to return to work the simple pleasures of picking her kids up from school and going grocery shopping are enough to make her giddy Not so fun is the feeding tube and a recent setback from an abscess on her liver which landed her back in the hospital She said there are days she is so tired she can t get off the couch It s a different life said Moore I have about one quarter of the energy I used to have before I got sick It s not like I m taking two mile walks every day with my latte CANCER BREAKTHROUGH DOZENS OF NEW GENE MARKERS COULD HELP PREDICT RISK But she is steadily improving and Kato is pleased with her most recent scans Coming up on her two year anniversary of the monster being gone as her brother referred to her pancreatic tumor Moore was back in Kato s office last week for a checkup Tall blond and lithe she looked the picture of health in her crisp blue jeans her clear green eyes beaming While other moms are miserable going through the teenage years I am reveling in the eye rolls and attitude I get and watching their lacrosse and basketball games to just getting to take care of them she said I made French toast and an omelet the other morning for them and thought Yeah I m back You

University of Oklahoma Editor s note This is the third post in our series on fashion inspired by musicals In case you missed them see Fashion Inspired by Wicked and Fashion Inspired by Les Miserables It s spooky season and that means one thing for fashion girls like us the perfect excuse to craft crazy costumes The Rocky Horror Picture Show though originally a musical is now most popularly known as a cult film Around Halloween many theaters host midnight showings of the movie complete with messy props full fledged costumes and maximum audience participation Last year Glee devoted an episode to this musical and introduced it to mainstream audiences While some people are annoyed with Glee for selling out certain musicals I take the opposite standpoint I think it s AWESOME that there s an avenue to expose people to Broadway who wouldn t know about it otherwise After all the more people begin to love musicals the cooler it makes us theater geeks look So you ve heard about these midnight RHPS showings and worked up the courage to attend one in your town now what Don t worry we re here to help Read on to learn everything you need to know before catching the Rocky Horror Picture Show Experience Science Fiction Double Feature As I m sure you ve heard before RHPS has an insane cult following Superfans have seen the film dozens of times know every lyric and every bit of dialogue and craft costumes that look nearly identical to the ones worn on screen There are a few things to know about the RHPS experience before you attend Know what you re getting into This may be obvious but the show is pretty racy There s a lot of pan sexuality involved so this probably isn t the greatest event to bring your young siblings grandma super conservative boyfriend to Initiation Before the show a host will usually call everyone who is attending a midnight showing for the first time to the front of the theater Typically they draw a V on your forehead with red lipstick and have you all repeat a racy oath of allegiance Often they have other silly or embarrassing games for Rocky Horror virgins to participate in but don t be afraid to opt out if it s something you aren t comfortable with Costume contests It is customary for audience members to dress up as characters from the film At some point before the show there will be a costume contest for each character and the winners get to act out scenes as they happen in the movie Obviously if it s your first time to see the show watching from the audience will probably be your best bet Props Be sure to check and find out if props will be provided at the venue you re seeing the film or musical at or if props are even permitted It s traditional to toss things like prunes toilet paper cards toast confetti etc at certain parts in the movie Click here for a full list of things you might need Call outs Catching a midnight showing of RHPS is also fun because of the callbacks shouted in response to lines the characters say Click here for a full script of what people say but don t worry too much about this part enough people in the audience will know the shout out script by heart Time Warp The one part of the film that virtually EVERYONE takes part in is the Time Warp dance Not to worry it s simple and silly and they tell you exactly what dance move to bust out kind of like the Cha Cha Slide Click here for a step by step tutorial if you want to come super prepared Creatures of the Night Here comes the fun part figuring out what to wear Just to warn you die hard fans take this very seriously They go to great lengths to make an absolutely PERFECT looking costume If this is what you re craving click here for some official RHPS costumes But if you re like me and prefer creating costumes that you can reuse or even wear in real life check out the outfits below for some fun costumes that work great as separates as well Another warning if you don t dress up for a midnight showing which is totally fine but sure not to wear anything striped For a brief second in the film crew members in striped shirts were accidentally caught on film It s now considered taboo to wear stripes to RHPS showings unless they re part of your costume Janet A Heroine Janet Weiss is an innocent girl who gets caught in a storm while traveling with her fiance Brad To capture her look wear pastel colors and lots of lace you re pretty much good with anything girly that contrasts with the look of the rest of the characters Finish the outfit with Janet s signature floppy sun hat Dress Cardigan Hat Shoes Socks Barrette Party People If you don t want to dress up as a specific character dress up as a party goer instead This look is simple pair a black blazer and slacks with any silly party favors you might have laying around things like party hats plastic shades noisemakers and anything glittery Finish the look with white socks and black shoes and get ready to pelvic thrust until you go insa a a a a ne Jacket Pants Shirt Bow Tie Shades Hat Columbia A Groupie Columbia is a tap dancing glitter enthusiast and Magenta s partner in crime Snag her look by well wearing as much glitter as possible Columbia s signatures are her top hat and mary jane tap shoes so be sure to include those in your outfit Finish by adding brightly colored makeup and hiding your eyebrows with foundation if you want to be extreme Corset Jacket Shorts Bow Tie Tights Shoes Hat Headband Magenta A Domestic Maid and Riff Raff s sister Magenta gets to sing the opening song of RHPS which is my favorite number She wears a traditional french maid costume but Magenta s true signature is her giant frizzy mass of hair Get her look by pairing a simple black dress with an apron if you have a lacy one that s great but a girly one you can use around the house works too Finish with dark eye makeup and red lipstick Apron Dress Bow Shoes Lipstick Tights Frank N Furter A Scientist Frank is the mad scientist and the main character of RHPS If corsets and garters aren t really your thing go for a most toned down gothic looking dress instead Add some badass boots his signature pearl necklace and dramatic make up to complete the costume Leggings Dress Necklace Lipstick Gloves Boots Don t Dream It Be It Have you been to a midnight showing of Rocky Horror Picture Show before What did you think Did it surprise you Would you consider dressing up and acting out one of the character s parts Who is your favorite character What s your favorite song Tell us with a comment I hope you had as much fun reading this post as I did writing it

those helpful kitchen related suggestions that old timers are so willing to share with the younger generations These little tips and tricks might be called kitchen hacks these days but they re still the same good old nuggets of wisdom that they always were As with any old wives tale hack or tip your mileage may vary Some of these gems have been around for several lifetimes and according to most grandmas they really work 1 For cleaning smelly hands after chopping onions or garlic just rub them on a stainless steel spoon The steel is supposed to absorb the odor 2 Fresh coffee beans can also absorb nasty odors from your hands 3 If you happen to over salt a pot of soup just drop in a peeled potato The potato will absorb the excess salt 4 When boiling eggs add a pinch of salt to keep the shells from cracking 5 Never put citrus fruits or tomatoes in the fridge The low temperatures degrade the aroma and flavor of these persnickety fruits 6 To clean cast iron cookwear don t use detergents Just scrub them with salt and a clean dry paper towel 7 Will milk curdle if it is allowed to boil It turns out that this age old piece of wisdom isn t true after all Milk that has been boiled is perfectly safe to consume 8 To clean an electric kettle with calcium buildup on the heating element boil a mixture of half white vinegar and half water then empty 9 When storing empty airtight containers throw in a pinch of salt to keep them from getting stinky 10 If you are making gravy and accidentally burn it just pour it into a clean pan and continue cooking it Add sugar a little at a time tasting as you go to avoid over sugaring it The sugar will cancel out the burned taste 11 Burned a pot of rice Just place a piece of white bread on top of the rice for 5 10 minutes to draw out the burned flavor Be careful not to scrape the burned pieces off of the bottom of the pan when serving the rice 12 Before you chop chili peppers rub a little vegetable oil into your hands and your skin won t absorb the spicy chili oil 13 If you aren t sure how fresh your eggs are place them in about four inches of water Eggs that stay on the bottom are fresh If only one end tips up the egg is less fresh and should be used soon If it floats it s past the fresh stage 14 To banish ants from the kitchen find out where they are coming in and cover the hole with petroleum jelly Ants won t trek through the jelly If they are coming under a door draw a line on the floor with chalk The little bugs also won t cross a line of chalk 15 Before making popcorn on the stove or in an air popper soak the kernels in water for 10 minutes Drain the water then pop as normal The additional moisture helps the popcorn pop up quicker and fluffier with fewer old maids 16 Don t store your bananas in a bunch or in a fruit bowl with other fruits Separate your bananas and place each in a different location Bananas release gases which cause fruits including other bananas to ripen quickly Separating them will keep them fresh longer 17 To keep potatoes from budding in the bag put an apple in with them 18 If you manage to have some leftover wine at the end of the evening freeze it in ice cube trays for easy addition to soups and sauces in the future 19 To clean crevices and corners in vases and pitchers fill with water and drop in two Alka Seltzer tablets The bubbles will do the scrubbing 20 After boiling pasta or potatoes cool the water and use it to water your house plants The water contains nutrients that your plants will love 21 When you clean your fish tank the water you drain can also be used to water your house plants The nitrogen and phosphorus in fish droppings make aquarium water a great fertilizer 22 When defrosting meat from the freezer pour some vinegar over it Not only does it tenderize the meat it will also bring down the freezing temperature of the meat and cause it to thaw quicker 23 The substance in onions that causes your eyes to water is located in the root cluster of the onion Cut this part out in a cone shape with the largest part of the cone around the exterior root section 24 Taking the top layer off of a onion can also reduce the amount of eye watering misery 25 Toothpaste is a great silver cleaner 26 Baking soda isn t as effective a deodorizer for the fridge as that baking soda company would like you to believe Activated charcoal is much better at absorbing fridge and freezer odors 27 Baking soda is an extremely effective cleaner though Use it with vinegar to deodorize drains and clean stovetops and sinks 28 A favorite tip of thousands of grandmas when you nick your finger while cutting veggies wait until the bleeding stops and paint on a layer of clear nail polish It will keep juices out of the wound and won t fall off into the spaghetti sauce like a bandage 29 The jury is still out on what to put in the bag of brown sugar to keep it from going hard a slice of apple a piece of bread and a shard of a terra cotta pot have all been used 30 Got a nasty invisible splinter from your kitchen tools Put a piece of adhesive tape on the area and then pull it off to remove the splinter 31 When you burn yourself in the kitchen just spread mustard on the affected area Leave it for a while and it will ease the pain and prevent blistering 32 For aluminum pans that are looking dull just boil some apple peels in them This will brighten up the aluminum and make your house smell yummy 33 To keep cookies fresh savvy grannies like to put some crumpled up tissue paper in the bottom of the cookie jar 34 If your salt is clumping up put a few grains of rice in with it to absorb excess moisture 35 To clean fruit stains off of your fingers rub them with a fresh peeled potato White vinegar can also do the trick 36 Keep iceberg lettuce fresh in the fridge by wrapping it in a clean dry paper towel and storing lettuce and paper towel in a sealed baggie in the fridge 37 If your loaf of bread is starting to go stale just put a piece of fresh celery in the bag and close it back up For some reason this restores a fresh taste and texture to the bread 38 Always keep an aloe vera plant in your kitchen It s invaluable when you scrape your arm or burn your finger Just break off a leaf and rub the gel from the inside on the injury 39 When making a soup sauce or casserole that ends up too fatty or greasy drop in an ice cube The ice will attract the fat which you can then scoop out 40 To reuse cooking oil without tasting whatever was cooked in the oil previously cook a 1 4 piece of ginger in the oil It will remove any remaining flavors and odors 41 If your milk always goes bad before you can finish it try adding a pinch of salt to the carton when you first open it It will stay fresh days longer 42 Water that has been boiled and allowed to cool will freeze faster than water from the tap This comes in handy when you re having a party and need ice pronto 43 Remove tea or coffee stains from your fine china by mixing up a paste of baking soda lemon juice and cream of tartar Rub it over the stains and they ll come off easily 44 If two drinking glasses become stuck together after stacking it s not impossible to unstick them Just put ice in the inner glass and dunk the outer glass in warm water The warm glass will expand and the cold glass will contract making the glasses separate easily 45 For splinters under the fingernail soaking the affected finger in a bowl of milk with a piece of bread in it is said to draw out the splinter 46 Did grandpa ever give you a drink of cola for an upset tummy It turns out that this is actually a pretty effective remedy The sugar and carbonation can soothe many tummy problems but it can also exacerbate others 47 Putting salty bacon on a boil is said to draw the poison out of boils 48 To help old wooden drawers without runners open and close smoothly rub a candle on the tracks 49 A cotton ball soaked in white vinegar and applied to a fresh bruise will reduce the darkness of the bruise and help it disappear sooner 50 Drinking cranberry juice and eating blueberries regularly will help stave off urinary tract infections you know all of those helpful

caps are often so small that it s easy to overlook the impact they have on the environment If you drop one on the ground at the park or the beach you may think it s not a big deal But the Beach Environmental Awareness Campaign Hawaii B E A C H found that plastic bottle caps are one of the top 10 items found during marine debris beach clean ups and are the second most littered item after cigarette butts Recycling seems like a good option but did you know that many cities don t accept caps for recycling Let s get down to the bottom of the bottle cap mystery and find out how they re recycled where they re accepted and what to do if your city doesn t take them The Beach Environmental Awareness Campaign Hawaii B E A C H found that plastic bottle caps are one of the top 10 items found during marine debris beach clean ups and are the second most littered item after cigarette butts All Plastics are Not Created Equal Just by physical touch you can tell the texture and durability of most plastic bottles is different from their caps This is because bottles and caps are made from different types of plastics Polyethylene terepthalate PET or plastic 1 often comprises plastic bottles while polypropylene PP or plastic 5 often makes up the caps So what s the big deal if the bottle is a 1 and the cap is a 5 They re both plastic right It all comes down to the melting point which has a difference of nearly 160 degrees Fahrenheit between the two If a cap gets mixed in with bottles the entire batch may be ruined because there is un melted plastic in the mix Plastic Pays All plastics go through the same recycling process They re sorted baled screened to remove contaminants washed ground into flakes separated from contaminants dried melted filtered and formed into pellets This is an expensive and time consuming process and recyclers want to make sure it s worth it financially Markets for different types of plastic vary around the country but based on the recycling rates posted from the 2007 U S National Postconsumer Plastics Bottle Recyling Report it s easy to infer that there s a larger market for PET which has a recycling rate of nearly 25 percent than PP which has a rate of less than 9 percent So if your city does not accept bottle caps it could be because the benefit is not large enough to support the cost What Major Cities are Doing Let s take a look at some cities that are taking steps to create bottle cap programs and others that do not accept caps for recycling San Francisco accepts caps even if they re left on the bottles Washington D C accepts emptied 1 7 plastics and lids Houston also accepts lids but unlike the two cities above it asks that the lids be removed from the bottle Also be sure to rinse before tossing them into the bin While New York City does not accept plastic caps metal caps can be removed from bottles and placed in the bin for recycling The City of Phoenix does not collect caps because 5 plastics can damage the sorting equipment be harmful to workers in the sorting facility or are too small to be sorted or make the sorting process inefficient San Diego also asks its residents not to recycle caps due to the differences in types of plastic It does however accept metal caps To check if your city accepts caps for recycling call or visit the Public Works or Department of Sanitation section of its Web site You can also search Earth911 com for plastic 5 or plastic bottle cap recycling locations How Private Companies are Stepping In If you re in an area where plastic cap recycling is not available seek out retailers that accept them A few of companies are taking the lead when it comes to tackling the issue of recycling 5 plastics Aveda a company known for its commitment to improving its impact on the environment through its naturally derived products eco friendly packaging and production processes accepts 5 plastic bottle caps for recycling at its stores and

involvement in mentoring program draws fire from school board member knights of columbus involvement in mentoring program draws fire from school board member knights of columbus involvement in mentoring program draws fire from school board member"",""body"":""BY ERIC VERONIKIS AND CATE McKISSICK Harrisburg School Board member Brendan Murray never thought he would have accusations of racism or bigotry thrown in his face in attempting to launch a mentoring program in the district But fellow board member Lola Lawson is fighting Murray s effort saying one of the three organizations he wants to involve in the program the Knights of Columbus is racist misogynistic and homophobic Lawson said her beef isn t personal and that she is looking out for the best interest of the students a majority of whom are black and the community Murray and the Knights of Columbus a Catholic charitable fraternal organization say Lawson s accusations are ridiculous The group doesn t exclude black people or any other race they said And while women aren t full members of the organization they can join its auxiliary or sister organization the Columbiettes said Gerald Krall the state advocate for the Knights of Columbus Krall said everything the Knights of Columbus does involves women and children As for Lawson s claims that the group opposes gays Krall said the Knights of Columbus are not against anyone but stand up for the principles of our Catholic faith and part of what we do is respect the sanctity of marriage Lawson doesn t oppose the other two groups Murray would like to involve in the program the Friends of Midtown and Harrisburg Young Professionals organizations But Lawson is convinced the Knights of Columbus exclude people of color and lobbies against gay marriage The Knights of Columbus will not come into the school district to be a part of a mentoring program I will fight that fervently Lawson said I don t care if Mr Murray likes it or not their history speaks for itself It is a fraternal organization all about men and the power of men Lawson continued I m sure we have gay children in our district If they are being mentored by people with that belief how is that impairing their self esteem Murray is a member of the Knights of Columbus council based out of Harrisburg s St Patrick Cathedral He claims Lawson s opposition to the Knights of Columbus is purely political and will address the issue during tonight s school board meeting She s using the mentor program as a political football Murray said After her committee meeting she had every opportunity to come to me to talk about her misgivings with the Knights of Columbus and she hasn t done that Murray said no research to back Lawson s claims of racism within the Knights of Columbus was ever provided to any of the board members We do social work he said of the organization that has more than 500 chapters across Pennsylvania We feed the homeless we man shelters so these people have a place to go We fund Little League teams across the nation School Board President Jennifer Smallwood did not return interview requests for this story Krall said Lawson s accusations are probably the most ridiculous remarks I ve ever heard Founded in 1882 in New Haven Conn a Catholic priest organized the Knights of Columbus to benefit widows and children The organization has evolved into a community charity that offers its own insurance services Lawson s claims are so ridiculous that if it wasn t so hurtful it would be laughable Krall said We have black members We have Asian members We are in all 50 states 12 countries and three territories Globally if you look at what the knights do the racist accusation is just pathetic he added We spent 1 million on Healing for Haiti We have over 1 8 million members globally Krall said the Knights of Columbus doesn t segregate chapters as Lawson claims And well before the civil rights movement the organization opened relief centers during World War II where everyone was welcome even when the military was segregated he said The Diocese of Harrisburg shared Krall s sentiments The Knights of Columbus supports many charitable and religious efforts that benefit not only the church but the general community said Joseph Aponick spokesman for the diocese The Knights of Columbus helps everyone regardless of race sex or religious beliefs Aponick said We welcome and applaud their volunteer service charitable donations scholarships and general offers of support to the church and community Aponick said The apparent offer of assistance by members of the Knights to the students of Harrisburg is in keeping with Catholic teachings of love of neighbor as well as their mission and tradition of devoting their time and energy toward the betterment of the community he added Charges of racism seem misinformed Bishop A E Sullivan Jr president of Harrisburg s Interdenominational Ministers Conference said students in all school districts need to be mentored He said he doesn t know enough about the Knights of Columbus to make a judgment call about the organization But Sullivan said he can understand why someone would be concerned about who is dealing with children especially in light of the Jerry Sandusky scandal at Penn State University Lawson claims that Murray can t accept when things don t go his way and if someone doesn t agree with him he gets overly upset and can t look at things objectively She said he walked out of the last school board meeting when the mentoring issue was raised Mr Murray has tried to intimidate me He has publicly disrespected me she said He has a problem with empowered black women For his part Murray said Lawson is part of the old guard and hates me because I ve come in here to try to make things

"http://www.hungryhappenings.com/2011/05/inside-out-chocolate-caramel-apples.html"	"9803"	"{""title"":""Inside Out Chocolate Caramel Apples make great teacher s gifts "",""body"":""The idea for this recipe came to me in stages Last week as I was making the little modeling chocolate apple that I used to decorate one of my chocolate chalkboards I made a full size apple thinking it would also make a great teacher s gift It looked like a real apple and I was going to do a post about it However as I continued to work on my chalkboards I decided to add a frame to one of the boards I knew it would be easy to make the frame out of light brown modeling chocolate so I melted some milk chocolate and went to grab my bottle of corn syrup There in the front of the cupboard was a can of Dulce de Leche Caramel Inspiration struck I swapped out this caramelized sweetened condensed milk for the corn syrup in my modeling chocolate recipe and after a bit of tweaking came up with a perfectly moldable chocolate that has a rich caramel flavor I made the frame for my chalkboard and thought about sharing this recipe in my last post but then inspiration struck again I used this new caramel modeling chocolate to make an apple which I dipped in red confectionery coating candy melts Although it looked great I couldn t stop there I really wanted this apple to taste like apple so I flavored the red candy coating with apple flavoring and a bit of citric acid for a sour note and poured it over the caramel chocolate apple My new creation had a hint of apple flavor and was bursting with caramel and chocolate flavors the exact opposite of a chocolate covered caramel apple thus the name inside out chocolate caramel apple I made my apples yesterday and took a lot of photographs then my husband came home and said they look more like tomatoes than apples Apples aren t all red they have streaks and spots of yellows and greens Yep he is right Although I think the apples look great pure red I did try streaking on some yellow and green luster dust and thought the effect was pretty nice I wouldn t necessarily go out and buy the luster dusts just for this project but it you have some on hand by all means use it to give your apples more depth These apples will make nice end of the school year thank you gifts for teacher s but would also be a fun gift to give to your doctor you know the apple a day saying If you don t make the apples you should at least try to make the caramel modeling chocolate next time you need some milk chocolate modeling chocolate I also used this recipe to make some dark caramel modeling chocolate changing the ratio of chocolate Dulce de Leche a bit and thought it had a nice but more subtle caramel flavor I ve yet to try it with white chocolate but when I do I ll be sure to let you know how it turns out Inside Out Chocolate Caramel Apples makes 4 Before you begin if you aren t experienced with making chocolate read my tutorial regarding types of chocolate how to melt chocolate and troubleshooting any problems you may encounter Ingredients 14 ounces good quality milk chocolate1 13 4 ounce can Dulce de Leche Caramel 8 ounces red confectionery coating candy melts1 2 dram 1 dram Apple Flavoring 1 3 drops green food coloringoptional a pinch of Citric AcidIf you prefer you can use Sour Green Apple Flavor Candy Flavoring Oil instead of the apple flavoring and citric acid Special Equipment Needed offset spatulawire cooling rackplastic wrap and parchment paperbaking sheet that fits in your freezerInstructions Melt milk chocolate and allow it to cool to about 91 degrees Fahrenheit For a detailed explanation of melting chocolate and why using melted chocolate that is too hot will result in oily modeling chocolate read this tutorial Stir in Dulce de Leche The mixture will get very thick but you need to make sure all of the caramel is mixed into the chocolate so use your hands if needed Once well mixed wrap in plastic wrap and let rest for at least 30 minutes When you unwrap the caramel modeling chocolate knead it on the counter just until smooth about 30 seconds Pinch off a teaspoonful of the caramel modeling chocolate and place in a bowl Add 1 3 drops of green food coloring and stir until well incorporated and green Pinch off a small amount of the green colored caramel modeling chocolate and roll into a ball Flatten and form into a leaf Repeat to make 4 leaves not pictured Pinch off about 1 2 teaspoonful of the caramel modeling chocolate and mold into a stem Repeat to create 4 stems Divide remaining caramel modeling chocolate into 4 balls roll and shape into an apple Use your finger to create an indentation on the top of each apple Melt red confectionery coating candy melts Place in a microwave safe bowl Heat on high for 25 seconds then stir Heat for 20 seconds and stir vigorously If not melted heat for 10 second increments stirring after each until melted Stir in 1 2 dram 1 2 teaspoon of the apple flavoring and citric acid if using Taste it and see if you d like it to have a stronger apple flavor If so add more apple flavoring Note If your candy coating gets thick you can add 1 2 teaspoon 1 teaspoon vegetable oil to thin it out Dip the bottom of each apple in the candy coating Smooth using an offset spatula Place in the freezer for 5 minutes so that the candy coating hardens Set a wire cooling rack over a piece of parchment paper Set caramel chocolate apple indentation side up on the cooling rack Pour red candy coating over the apple Tap the cooling rack a few times This will help the candy coating to run down the sides of the apple Make sure the entire apple is covered especially around the bottom Use a spatula to fill in any places that aren t covered in the candy coating Carefully lift the apple using an offset spatula and place on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper Immediately add the stem and leaf to the indentation in the apple Place in freezer for 8 10 minutes until candy coating is hardened Repeat with remaining apples I suggest you freeze each apple as you complete it as the red candy coating has a tendency to dry with white streaks if left at room temperature for too long Don t freeze the apples for too long either or they might crack get sticky or streak You can purchase boxes or cellophane bags to package your apples if you plan to give them as gifts The apples will keep for at least one month if kept in an airtight container To serve use a sharp knife to cut the apple into wedges or just take a bite If you want to add embellishments to your apple you can write a special message on the outside of the apple using a food coloring marker You can also make some decorations out of modeling chocolate and attach them to the apple How about a worm or a graduation cap or even a cute face Have fun creating and be sure to send me pictures of your apples beth hungryhalloween com "",""url"":""hungryhappenings 2011 05 inside out chocolate caramel apples

accomplish anything in life whether it is work raising a family or even having fun you need to have energy When we run into trouble in the form of bad moods or poor productivity its usually because we are low on energy Oddly many of us willingly subject ourselves daily to factors that suck us dry Here is a list of the top 10 energy zapping offenders and how you can avoid them Lack of SleepDuh right Well how come we don t get enough sleep It needs to be a priority and you need to muster up the proper motivation to make it happen Now not everyone needs 8 hours of sleep but some do How do you figure out how much you need Experiment Measure how much you need by how you feel the next day Are you dragging with droopy eyelids all day if you only sleep for 7 hours Then that s not enough If you feel mostly alert then you ve hit on the right amount for you SugarAvoid it If you must eat sweets try to combine them with fiber which slows the absorption of sugar into the bloodstream Most fruits naturally have both the sweetness and the fiber The next time you have a candy bar or can of soda watch for the subsequent energy dip that occurs within 30 60 minutes Be prepared to nap because that s what you will feel like doing CaffeineI m sorry but caffeine is the big lie Don t hate me It s simply the laws of physics For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction Caffeine follows this law Initially you will see a kick of energy from caffeine but everyone pays the price later in terms of tiredness insomnia or irritability This is obviously a personal choice but there are many including myself who have improved their life by eliminating or decreasing their caffeine intake Here is an article with both pros and cons to help you decide if you want to kick the caffeine habit Lack of ExerciseIf you don t use it you lose it Your muscles store and therefore provide energy Exercise gives you energy especially if you do it on a regular basis Shoot for 20 30 minutes everyday to improve your energy levels Another simple thing you can do is take a 5 minute break every hour to get up from your work to stretch and walk around a bit So if you re feeling lethargic get your blood pumping by moving your body If you re feeling exhausted on a particular day see 1 and get some rest instead Not Enough OxygenMany of us have shallow breathing most of the time When we do that we re not getting enough oxygen which is the element we need to burn fuel inside our bodies for energy Deep breathing will serve another important purpose and that is moving fluids through the lymph system Your lymph system eliminates toxins which in turn frees your body to work on more important things like your goals What to do 2 3 times a day take 5 minutes to do 10 slow long deep breaths Breath in slowly hold and then release slowly too You ll be amazed how good this makes you feel Processed FoodsThe more live foods you eat fruits and vegetables the more alive you will feel Seek to eat healthy foods whole grains fruits vegetables lean proteins and good fats such as found in salmon walnuts flax seeds and olive oil Here are some additional healthy eating tips DehydrationThis is an often overlooked cause of fatigue When you don t get enough water blood flow to your organs including your brain is slowed down making you tired At a minimum be sure to at least drink enough water to replace what you lose through your daily activities This amount will vary from person to person While many people scoff at the 8 glasses per day rule it is indeed a good rule of thumb as explained here It is also important to note that your water needs can come from juices and other beverages but bear in mind that caffeinated drinks will make your body shed water so you may need to drink more if you drink a lot of caffeine Be safe about it and just drink more water StressLife is stressful by definition but for many of us we make it worse by overfilling our schedules Instead stop trying to do it all Figure out what is most important to you Cut out the rest Trim your schedule Learn to say no And try meditation By simply meditating once or twice a day for 10 20 minutes will make a huge difference in your stress levels If you re tired in the middle of the day a meditation nap is a great way to rejuvenate your energy Another thing to elevate your happiness and decrease stress is to practice gratitude and be mindful of keeping your internal voice focused on the glass being half full Chronic PainDaily pain can take the form of debilitating back pain or as simple as chronic foot pain from wearing tight shoes The thing with chronic pain is we become used to it to a certain degree Many people just live with it This is not good because chronic pain robs you of energy Pay attention to your body to identify any pain you are experiencing on a daily basis and come up with a plan to alleviate it So for example if you always feel enormous relief upon taking off your shoes at night you might want to find more comfortable shoes If you have sciatica pain you might want to begin a slow regimen of simple stretches such at toe touching and hip opener stretches If you are having knee pain and are carrying extra weight losing some weight might help relieve that daily pain Other pain relieving strategies include stretching massage acupuncture or a pain management program from a doctor who specializes in this Toxic PeoplePeople who are negative can rob some of your energy too if you let them There are a few actions you can take Make a commitment to not engage with negative people Don t fight with them Don t expect better from them Instead try to practice compassion for them Maybe their negativity is a reflection of pain in their life Focus on that when having to deal with them Be kind and make it a point to spend time with positive people every day Wishing you tons of energy Please share your best energy tips with us in the comments dumb little man shares

lack of proper crediting on the site especially since tumblr credits by default Anyway thank you for sharing these Teresa January 3rd 2010 at 5 09 am Stunning I agree with your tumblr sentiments I will unfollow someone if they start posting things without credit and have no comment system that you can use FFFound is terrible in this way as well MadeleineLouise January 3rd 2010 at 6 46 am Those

one Meme January 4th 2010 at 1 14 pm I think Tumblr fffound etc are hard to pin down on the one hand many people like myself use it basically as a place to keep images that we find inspiring or beautiful which is personal and not commercial at all But for some especially the handful of tumblr posters who are obviously ranking highly and passing many things along to millions it seems they would realize credit may be due For myself I usually delete any caption from images simply because I like the clean tumblr aesthetic of only images but I post a link to the artist creator blog where I found it 99 9 of the time As for the images above very lovely luxirare January 4th 2010 at 1 37 pm haha small world Lumi tell Setareh I say Hi luxirare January 4th 2010 at 3 00 pm Thanks so much for

Make Exercise a Daily Habit "",""body"":""Post written by Leo Babauta Follow me on Twitter Recently my friend and fellow blogger Scott Young did a great post entitled New to exercise Make workouts daily It was an excellent post and perfectly timed as it mirrors my own recent efforts at making exercise a daily habit The problem with trying to make exercise a habit and it s something that we ve all faced is that you usually try to exercise 3 or 4 times a week and that makes creating a new exercise habit difficult The reason is that the more consistent an action is the more likely it is to be a habit Therefore as Scott points out and it s something I fully agree with exercising every day is more likely to result in a habit something that becomes almost automatic and much easier instead of a constant struggle I ve been implementing this idea in my daily life recently alternating every day between different exercises running swimming biking and strength workouts as a way of reaching my goal of completing an Olympic distance triathlon this year I m going to continue this habit change into the month of May I made daily running a habit last year when I was training for my first marathon but this year I stopped when I got sick so I m re starting the habit formation If you re going to make this a habit do a 30 day Challenge and by the end of the challenge your habit should be pretty well ingrained Here are some practical suggestions I ve learned along the way to help make exercise a daily habit Set a time Decide whether you re more likely to stick with it in the morning or lunchtime or evening and stick with that time I ve set the time of 5 30 a m every day and I m trying my best not to vary from that time If you don t set a time you re more likely to put it off until you have more time or energy and then put it off until the next day Soon it s not a habit at all Send yourself a reminder I use Memo to Me but there are a number of ways to send yourself an email or text reminder so you ll never forget Then when you get the reminder do it right away Don t brook any delays Start small This is perhaps the most useful suggestion of all When I start exercising I always start with lots of energy enthusiasm and ambition I think I can do more than I can However doing too much in the beginning leads to burnout which leads to quitting your habit When you first try to make exercise a daily habit chances are your body won t be used to that kind of stress The key only do 20 minutes in the beginning and do it nice and easy Nothing hard Even 10 15 minutes is fine at first if you re just starting out The key is to get out there get your body slowly used to daily exercise and form that habit Progress later Once your body is used to daily exercise you can slowly start to increase the amount and intensity of your exercise Wait at least two weeks before starting to increase that s the minimum your body needs to adjust Once it begins to feel way too easy you can start increasing the length of your workouts to 30 and then 40 minutes and eventually up to an hour Once you do that you can gradually increase the intensity running faster or harder for example Try not to increase both distance and intensity at the same time Make it pleasurable If you associate a habit with pain you will shy away from it But if it s fun you ll look forward to doing it That s why in this beginning stage of my new habit I ve been focusing on pleasure I go slowly enjoying the scenery the fresh morning air the beautiful sky as the sun rises the quiet time of solitude and contemplation It s actually something I enjoy doing An mp3 player with some great music helps Lay out your gear The fewer obstacles and less friction there is in forming your new habit the more likely you are to be successful If you have to not only wake up early but get a bunch of gear together while half awake you might just want to go back into bed But if you lay out your workout clothes and shoes and watch and mp3 player or whatever you need for your exercise you ll be ready to go with no friction at all Just head out the door My rule is just to get my running shoes on and get out the door I don t worry about how long I have to go or how hard it will be Just get out and get started Once I ve done that it s a piece of cake Mix it up One thing I like about triathlon training is that daily exercise isn t boring instead of running every single day now I ve got a variety of sports to do and that makes it much more interesting But perhaps just as important is that with each sport I m using different muscles especially with swimming Sure some of the same muscles are used but they re used differently with different stresses on them What that means is that I m not pounding the same muscles every day That gives them a chance to recover because without recovery you re just breaking your muscles down over and over Have a relative rest day Again recovery is very important Which is why you need to give your body a chance to rest If you re taking it easy and only doing 20 minutes you should be OK without rest days But it s still good to have one day of rest where you re not doing the same exercises as the other six days You don t want to skip the day completely because then you re not being consistent with your habit That s why I do one day of strength training where I don t use the same muscles as swimming biking and running If you need more rest you could just do 20 minutes of walking or even just a session of meditation The key is to do something every day preferably something that gets you moving meditation isn t the best example but at least you d be doing something and keeps your habit formation going Don t skip a day It s easy to say No problem I ve been doing it for five days I ll just skip today But that will make your habit formation harder Consistency is key so try not to skip a single day If you do don t beat yourself up don t judge don t feel bad everyone messes up sometimes and habit formation is a skill that requires practice Just start your 30 day challenge over again and try to identify the obstacle that led to your skipping a day and prepare for it this time ""}"	"?"

"http://proletariatkitchen.tumblr.com/"	"9041"	"{""title"":""Proletariat Kitchen "",""body"":""Rice is a staple food in a large portion of the worlds diet ranging from Asia to Africa and the Americas Rice is viewed as a peasant food in some regions of the world while in others it is viewed as a health food the macrobiotic diet holds great importance on eating brown rice however in many cultures across the globe rice is viewed as sacred containing creation myths such as the Javanese story of Batara Guru and Samyam Sri The Rice Book Sri Owen 51 or by being stored in holy rice barns as is the case with many rice growers in the Japanese culture The Rice Book Sri Owen 27 I simply like the taste of rice especially the nutty flavor of brown rice and I feel great after eating a meal that includes rice Rice Oryza sativa Oryza glaberrima is native to West Africa is a grass that is related to other grass descendent cereals such as wheat oats and barley Broadly speaking there are three types of rice long medium and short grain Other terms are also used in different regions of the world to describe the same general shape such as patna rose and pearl which are synonymous with long medium and short grain respectively The Rice Book Sri Owen 6 There are also many types of rice available for purchase depending on how the rice has been processed or milled This includes white rice which has been fully milled had the bran coat removed and most likely water polished talc was once used to create an extra whitening effect Brown rice which has been associated with poverty in the past also called whole rice or Italian semigreggio is rice with its bran intact thus increasing the nutrition of brown rice over white rice Parboiled rice is rice that has been soaked steamed dried and then milled causing some nutrients from the bran to adhere to the endosperm of the rice and decreasing the brittleness of the grain Uncle Ben s rice is parboiled The Rice Book Sri Owen 6 8 One reason rice is so popular is it s nutritive value Rice contains many B group vitamins such as Thiamin which helps prevent Beriberi a disease that afflicts poverty sticken regions who ingest only polished white rice which is lower in Thiamine than brown rice Riboflavin Niacin Vitamin B6 and Folate Rice in combination with beans can provide a complete set of amino acids to create a protein and rice has plenty of fiber especially brown rice to keep things moving smoothly The Rice Book Sri Owen 14 16 In addition many just enjoy the neutrality of it s flavor and it s ability to compliment most meals perfectly Something most associated with rice growing is the flooded field or paddy Rice can also be grown in dry fields however there are certain benefits associated with flooding the fields The flooded fields insulate the crop from extreme heat and cold drown out the weeds protect against pests and possibly provide extra nutrients for the plants due to many of the critters passing through The fields only remain flooded for a few weeks or months at a time A draw back to this method is the amount of water required for a large volume of rice especially in our modern world where water security is ever so important Also because of the anaerobic conditions that flooding fields create organic matter in the soil begins to ferment emitting large amounts of methane http www ipcc ch pdf assessment report ar4 syr ar4 syr pdf To properly prepare rice I have found through experimentation that the best ratio of rice to water is 1 cup rice to 2 cups water for white rice or 2 1 2 cups water for brown rice Visually in a small pot the water will extend just below the top knuckle of the index finger for white rice and just on the top knuckle of the index finger for brown rice when the index finger is placed in the water with the rice To cook the rice cover and cook slightly higher than low heat for approximately 20 minutes for white and 26 minutes for brown rice The water and starch will boil out of the pot which is normal When the water has boiled out tunnels will appear in the rice At this time turn off the heat and let sit covered for 5 to 10 minutes While the rice is cooling it will continue to soften You may need to adjust the time and heat according to your stove however by following this general method you should get perfectly cooked rice Though the traditional rice cooking methods have been adequate for thousands of years a recently reported people may have been doing this for ages new method is gaining popularity for its health benefits over regular cooking methods This method is called Germinated Brown Rice in Japanese hatsuga genmai or GBR GBR is also called GABA for the presences of gamma aminobutyric acid GABA of which increases by twice as much during germination compared to regularly prepared brown rice GABA is a neurotransmitter inhibitor that promotes the production of Human Growth Hormone may increase the sleep cycle giving deeper rest boost the immune system inhibit the development of cancer cells as well as assist in the treatment of anxiety In addition to GABA other nutrients that are increased when brown rice is germinated are dietary fiber inositols ferulic acid phytic acid tocotrienols magnesium potassium zinc gamma oryzanol and a prolylendopeptide base inhibitor FAO UN International Year Of Rice Marketing of Value Added Rice Products in Japan What does that all mean Well that it s possibly good for your brain relieving constipation preventing colon cancer regulating blood sugar levels preventing heart disease lowering blood pressure and preventing Alzheimer s Now that we know how good GBR is how do we prepare it It s relatively easy and just requires a little patience First select good brown rice to germinate I get mine in bulk from the 4th Street Co op here in New York Then soak in warm water between 80 to 100 degrees for about 20 hours or longer with cooler temperatures I placed the pot of rice on my radiator to keep it warm Change the water a few times depending on the smell developed during soaking A trick to help reduce the smell is to soak the rice in green tea due to the antiseptic properties of the tea This technique may also increase the abundance of GABA Mellow Monk Green Tea Blog After the rice has begun to germinate lightly wash and cook as normal slightly reducing the amount of water When finished the rice will be softer and easier to digest when compared to traditionally prepared brown rice Some of the information I gathered is from The Rice Book by Sri Owen

one of the most competitive industries in the nation and tough competition calls for innovation But sometimes fast food restaurants have gone a little too far when trying to find the next big hit Not every innovative new product is a hit with customers and some are downright flops Here are 10 fast food items that were a total failure McDonald s Hula Burger McDonald s Hula Burger was originally intended to be a Lent friendly burger that is a burger with no meat What was between the buns you ask Why a pineapple of course Needless to say this odd combination wasn t too big of a hit with consumers and the concept was quickly scrapped in favor of more conventional products Wendy s Superbar The Wendy s Superbar was a hybrid salad bar buffet that the franchise set up in more of its restaurants throughout the country The problem is that the super bar isn t exactly fast food and the slowdown doesn t exactly result in higher quality food By the early 1990s the Superbar became extinct though this angered many people who had grown accustomed to the bar Websites have been dedicated to lobbying Wendy s to bring back the Superbar But only time will tell if the campaign will work McDonald s McSpaghetti Believe it or not McDonald s has dabbled in the realm of fine Italian cuisine with the introduction of McSpaghetti Reviews of this dish were mixed in the United States and it was quickly discontinued but other countries throughout the world such as the Philippines still offer the strange dish on their menu often paired with a fried chicken leg McDonald s DLT What happens when you separate the cold side of the burger lettuce tomato and pickle from the hot side of the burger meat and cheese and force the consumer to put the two together You get a magical fast food failure of epic proportions That s exactly what happened with McDonald s DLT burger which was the product of millions of dollars of research development and marketing Taco Bell Frito Burrito This may not sound like a complete failure if you re from the Soutwest but this Frito pie burrito didn t resonate with the rest of America Taco Bell s Frito burrito actually gained a serious cult following but its sales immediately slumped due to the awkward pairing of Mexican style food with Frito s Loyal fans have persevered however and Taco Bell appears to be re launching a similar burrito with flamin hot Fritos inside We ll have to wait and see if this pairing works out better than the original McDonald s Arch Deluxe Once the signature hamburger for McDonald s the Arch Deluxe was intended to be an adult version of the quarter pounder on a signature bun with specialized ingredients After all what s more adult than secret mustard An executive chef world renowned marketing guru and 300 million dollars later McDonald s launched the Arch Deluxe campaign To their dismay the Arch Deluxe just didn t taste very good and this led to a very short shelf life Jack in the Box Frings It sounds simple enough rather than offering only French fries or onion rings just add both items to a single serving box and sell it In the spirit of combination why not call the item frings That s exactly what Jack in the Box decided to do The public however didn t enjoy the pun as much as expected Frings have been on and off of Jack in the Box s menu for years and it doesn t look like they re coming back anytime soon McDonald s McLobster The McLobster has been a source of controversy and rumors for many years now Yes even though it s a sandwich the mystery surrounding its occasional availability has left consumers wondering if this menu item has what it takes to make it on the mainstream market McDonald s recently shed new light on the controversy however but stating that the McLobster would not become a main staple of its menu due to poor reviews and the expense of producing it Taco BellBeefer What happens when you take a Taco Bell taco remove the contents and put them on a hamburger bun No it s not a sloppy joe it s the Taco Bell BellBeefer and in the 70s and 80s it was Taco Bell s key to competing with hamburger based fast food chains Like some other items on this list the BellBeefer had a rabid and loyal fanbase but unfortunately it just didn t have the staying power necessary to make it a staple item on Taco Bell s menu Burger King Veggie Burger You heard right Burger King offers a veggie burger Is it any good Results are mixed but there have been some indications that this burger is about to be the newest addition to a long list of fast food failures This entry

among 25 healthy individuals living in a controlled setting who were randomized to overconsumption of different levels of protein diets those consuming the low protein diet had less weight gain compared to those consuming normal and high protein diets and calories alone and not protein appeared to contribute to an increase in body fat according to a study in the January 4 issue of JAMA The researchers also found that protein did contribute to changes in energy expenditure and lean body mass Obesity has become a major public health concern with more than 60 percent of adults in the United States categorized as overweight and more than 30 percent as obese according to background information in the article The role of diet composition in response to overeating and energy dissipation is unclear George A Bray M D of the Pennington Biomedical Research Center Baton Rouge La and colleagues conducted a study to determine whether the level of dietary protein differentially affected body composition weight gain or energy expenditure under tightly controlled conditions The randomized controlled trial included 25 U S healthy weight stable male and female volunteers ages 18 to 35 years with a body mass index between 19 and 30 The first participant was admitted to the inpatient metabolic unit in June 2005 and the last in October 2007 After consuming a weight stabilizing diet for 13 to 25 days participants were randomized to receive diets containing 5 percent of energy from protein low protein 15 percent normal protein or 25 percent high protein which they were overfed during the last 8 weeks of their 10 to 12 week stay in the inpatient metabolic unit Compared with energy intake during the weight stabilization period the protein diets provided approximately 40 percent more energy intake which corresponds to 954 calories a day All participants in the study gained weight and there were no differences by sex The rate of weight gain in the low protein diet group was significantly less than in the other 2 groups 6 97 lbs 3 16 kg vs 13 3 lbs 6 05 kg for the normal protein diet group and 14 4 lbs 6 51 kg in the high protein diet group Body fat increased similarly in all 3 protein diet groups and represented 50 percent to more than 90 percent of the excess stored calories Resting energy expenditure total energy expenditure and body protein did not increase during overfeeding with the low protein diet the authors write Lean body mass body protein decreased during the overeating period by 1 5 lbs 0 70 kg in the low protein diet group compared with a gain of 6 3 lbs 2 87 kg in the normal protein diet group and 7 lbs 3 18 kg in the high protein diet group Resting energy expenditure normal protein diet 160 calories day high protein diet 227 calories day increased significantly with the normal and high protein diets In summary weight gain when eating a low protein diet 5 percent of energy from protein was blunted compared with weight gain when eating a normal protein diet 15 percent of energy from protein with the same number of extra calories Calories alone however contributed to the increase in body fat In contrast protein contributed to the changes in energy expenditure and lean body mass but not to the increase in body fat the researchers write The key finding of this study is that calories are more important than protein while consuming excess amounts of energy with respect to increases in body fat JAMA 2012 307 1 47 55 Available pre embargo to the media at www jamamedia org Editor s Note Please see the article for additional information including other authors author contributions and affiliations financial disclosures funding and support etc Editorial Overeating and Overweight Extra Calories Increase Fat Mass While Protein Increases Lean Mass In an accompanying editorial Zhaoping Li M D Ph D and David Heber M D Ph D of the University of California Los Angeles write that the results of this study informs primary care physicians and policy makers about the benefits of protein in weight management The results suggest that overeating low protein diets may increase fat deposition leading to loss of lean body mass despite lesser increases in body weight Policy makers and primary care physicians need to understand the role of the Western diet in promoting overweight and obesity Because this diet increases the risks of overnutrition through fat deposition beyond that detected by body mass index the method used to assess the current obesity epidemic and the magnitude of the obesity epidemic may have been underestimated Clinicians should consider assessing a patient s overall fatness rather than simply measuring body weight or body mass index and concentrate on the potential complications of excess fat accumulation The goals for obesity treatment should involve fat reduction rather than simply weight loss along with a better understanding of nutrition science

attempt to climb the highest peak in Texas contrary to popular belief Texas is not flat it actually stretches up to the sky in the area of 8 700 feet In theory I should be able to achieve this but my chance of failure is pretty high in my current physical state It s high time I start to put some real action behind my goal to lose a little and shape up I m writing this off of a weekend that had me biking 40 miles a week where I forced myself to eat gasp 2 salads and walk a minimum of 15 miles Part of this plan was not really to eat stuff better for me but exercise portion control while enjoying the same high quality of flavor I m used to A perfect example is this beautiful bowl of Vietnamese pork resting atop a pile of vermicelli When I say I m not sacrificing flavor I mean it Vietnamese pork is insanely delicious Sliced pork shoulder is marinated in a mixture of garlic fish sauce and sugar to embed the meat in and out with great taste The thin pieces of pork brown quickly over the grill and are excellent in their own right but with accompaniments it gets even better First is a bed of vermicelli thin rice noodles found in a lot of Asian dishes The noodles themselves don t have much going on which makes them such a great base because they soak up some of the flavor of the pork and the nuoc cham added at the end Second is lettuce and mint which adds a real freshness to the whole thing that would otherwise be missing Besides I consider anything with green in it to be pretty healthy Shamrock shake anyone Now for the portion control side of things I could easily sit and devour this entire plate of tasty tasty swine but if I put just a few pieces over the noodles and top with lettuce and mint that will be all that I eat Finished bowl finished meal and I avoid the nastiness of overeating I tend to suffer from when food is just sitting around open form think a rack of ribs laying on a cutting board Put all together and given the final topping of nuoc cham this is really a dish that had it all The cool noodles played off the warm pork the lettuce added a crunch while the mint tossed some herbal essence into the mix A side note to its awesomeness when I was finished the bowl I didn t feel like I ate any more than I should have and couldn t have asked for something with more great flavors than this had Only problem now I m about to embark on a two day barbecue tour of NYC and there s not a chance in hell I m holding myself back on that Bring on the cue Vietnamese Pork with Vermicelli Adapted from Une deux Senses Ingredients For the marinade8 cloves of garlic minced5 tablespoons fish sauce4 tablespoons sugar1 2 tsp ground black pepper 2 pounds of pork shoulder1 package of rice vermicelli1 head of butter lettuce torn into small pieces1 bunch of

downer overall right A presidential primary an NBA lockout and a wicked lame BCS rematch in NCAA football No thank you Whether or not 2011 was an overall net loss for sports is yet to be determined but the one thing we can say for sure is that there were plenty of sexy moments worth watching in 2011 I ve compiled the top 50 Sexiest Sports Moments in 2011 as determined by me for your viewing pleasure Take a gander enjoy the amazingness and obviously feel free to let me know what I ve missed Here are the top 50 Sports Moments of 2011 50 Jay Cutler Kristin Cavallari Back On Bears quarterback Jay Cutler might be something to see on the field from time to time but thanks to his volatile relationship with Laguna Beach hottie Kristin Cavallari he s something to see off the field as well Cutler and Cavallari s on again off again relationship is officially back on The pair are re engaged and it looks like we ll have a wedding to ogle this NFL off season Celebrity couple nickname JayStin no doubt the future name of their first born child 49 Caroline Wozniacki Teases Rafael Nadal At a press conference during 2011 U S Open Caroline Wozniacki had a little fun at superstar Rafael Nadal s expense when she imitated his dramatic leg cramp performance at his own press conference the day before The 21 year old took a lot of heat for her so called disrespect but it was obvious she was just having a little fun A sense of humor is sexy and being an oversensitive complainer who is allergic to fun is not 48 Chris Kluwe Takes a Stand for All Idiot Kickers NFL punters kickers take a lot of flack for not being real football players but like it or not they provide a service that is as valuable if not more than the majority of the real players on the team Perhaps it s in the interest of self preservation but most kickers tend to stick to the seen and not heard code of conduct expected of them Vikings punter Chris Kluwe was much the same way until failed NFL receiver Nate Jackson who scored less points in his entire NFL career than some kickers score in a single game had the nerve to suggest publicly on Deadspin com that he was nothing more than a scrawny turncoat whose main purpose is to serve as a sacrificial meal to the real players in the event of a plane crash Jackson probably expected him to slink away with his tail between his legs but Kluwe took a stand for World of Warcraft playing nerds everywhere and absolutely eviscerated Jackson less than 24 hours later publicly on Deadspin com with the biting wit and pitch perfect sarcasm of someone who never bowed down to a bully in his entire life Swoon 47 Alexander Ovechkin Lands Maria Kirilenko Capitals slumping superstar Alexander Ovechkin might not be the best looking guy in any room but that doesn t mean he can t land the best looking broad in any room In late November 2011 Ovi announced via Twitter that he was dating tennis goddess and fellow Russian Maria Kirilenko He smartly included a picture of the two of them together just in case you were skeptical of the whole thing Tweeted Ovi Me and my girlfriend Maria she is my queen Well the nation s capital just got a whole lot sexier and as I resident of said capital I m enthused My advice to Ovi Lock it down bro there aren t many relationship that you d be the reacher in but this is one 46 Stacy Keibler at Home with Esquire Esquire s feature Me in My Place is a series of intimate moments with beautiful women presumably in their own homes Stacy Keibler took time out of her busy schedule of driving men wild to participate Keibler often dressed in a white tank top and underwear which she says she lives in and revealed what she wears when she goes to bed Nothing Naturally 45 Tony LaRussa s Daughter Bianca Becomes a Raiderette The good news Recently retired St Louis Cardinals skipper Tony LaRussa s crazy hot daughter Bianca Tai announced via Twitter that she achieved her dream of becoming an Oakland Raiderette That was in April 2011 The bad news In late September 2011 Bianca announced via Twitter that thanks to bulging and or herniated discs the dream was over So I guess it is true after all nothing good lasts forever 44 Jan Vesely Kisses Eva Kodouskova Czech Republic native Jan Vesely was drafted No 6 overall in the 2011 NBA draft by the Washington Wizards After the selection was announced Vesely took a moment to plant one on his tall blonde girlfriend Eva Kondouskova before heading up to the stage to meet commissioner David Stern We get it dude your life rules 43 Cole Hamels Becomes a Man According to Phillies manager Charlie Manuel 27 year old pitcher Cole Hamels has finally developed into a man In June 2011 Manuel said click the link for hilarious video of Hamels He s bigger than he used to be If you see him with his shirt and stuff off he s development into a man His shirt and stuff off Well I guess we re going to have to take Manuel s word on that one but considering this 2009 photo was his jumping off point Hamels is in mighty fine shape 42 Reggie Bush Replaces Kim with Kim Reggie Bush grabbed headlines in June 2011 when it was reported that he was dating model Melissa Molinaro Molinaro s resemblance to Bush s ex Kim Kardashian did not go unnoticed by anyone especially Kim who sued Old Navy for using a model that vaguely resembled her Bush and Molinaro may still be together but they haven t been seen together in quite awhile although Bush has reportedly been seen with someone else recently Kim Kardashian 41 Nicki Minaj Gives Steve Nash a Lap Dance In April 2011 Suns point guard Steve Nash went to see Lil Wayne s I m Still Music tour in Phoenix He may have gone for the music but he stayed for the lap dance courtesy of Hip Hop hottie Nicki Minaj Nash was pulped up on stage where he could get a close up but hands off view of Minaj shaking her inexplicably heavenly booty which is nothing short of legendary 40 LFL s Kellie Gillispie Elected to Public Office Kelli Gillispie plays corner and defensive end for the Minnesota Valkyrie of the Lingerie Football League When she s not cracking skulls in the LFL Gillispie who owns her own business is also a City Council member serving the good people of Mound Minnesota The first year council woman and former gymnast makes no apologies to those who want to talk crap about the LFL s required uniform and why should she Girl looks good Politics could use more Kelli Gillispies and way less Newt Gingriches and Anthony Weiners 39 ESPN Hires Lindsay Czarniak When they hired Lindsay Czarniak ESPN continued their tradition of find the best of the best beautiful blonde sports broadcaster this country has to offer The beloved Czarniak is sorely missed in Washington D C but the national capital s loss is the nation s gain Unlike the painfully awkward Sara Walsh and boring as crap Charissa Thompson the competent and confident Czarniak already seems at home on the network and despite some early nerves has the best chance to rise to Erin Andrews status 38 Rex Michelle Ryan Fetish Video Scandal Just four days before Christmas 2010 DeadSpin com reported that Jets head coach Rex Ryan and wife Michelle may or may not be in the habit of making amateur foot fetish videos and posting them on the Internet Well it turns out they were The whole foot thing may or may not be your thing but you gotta give the Ryan s props for keeping things spicy 37 Anna Kournikova Gets a Job Despite only achieving marginal success as a tennis player over a decade ago the alluring Anna Kournikova has remained one of the most desired women in the world There may be new crop of dazzling tennis beauties to admire but a suddenly employed Kournikova s new gig on NBC s The Biggest Loser means that she isn t going anywhere 36 Brian Wilson s Spandex Tuxedo San Francisco Giants relief picture donned a spandex tuxedo white gloves an orange bow tie sweet shades and a cane for the 2011 ESPY awards Even if you don t think his whole look is sexy you re wrong you have to appreciate the confidence it takes to go anywhere in head to toe spandex 35 Kristin Cavallari Short Lived Stint on DWTS The future Mrs Jay Cutler and least for now Kristin Cavallari put on her dancing shoes and shook her assets on Season 13 of ABC s Dancing with the Stars and she looked mighty fine doing it Unfortunately she was eliminated in just week three of the competition an inexplicable five weeks before CNN s Nancy Grace 34 Los Angeles Tempation Win Lingerie Bowl The Lingerie Football League s Los Angeles Temptation won the second biggest football championship held on February 6 2011 The event was a hard hitting battle that certainly beats the crap out of the puppy bowl and don t even get me started on how much women playing football in their underwear is that being subjected to the The Black Eyed Peas Also I d like to add that as a Steelers fan it was the only positive memory of an otherwise very drunken angry day of trying to start fights with strangers 33 Erin Andrews Takes Gatorade Bath with RGIII The time honored Gatorade bath after an important victory got a lot sexier in late November when ESPN s and national treasure Erin Andrews was caught in the path of Gatorade meant for Baylor quarterback Robert Griffin III following their upset of Oklahoma Naturally Andrews took it like the champ she is and smiled through the whole ordeal despite being drenched on live television 32 Alexa Flutie Becomes a Patriots Cheerleader Undersized underdog quarterback Doug Flutie spent some of his best days playing football in New England both with the Patriots and his alma mater Boston College Flutie s smokin hot daughter Alexa is his biggest fan and now a rookie cheerleader for the New England Patriots 31 Terrell Owens Works out Without a Shirt Free agent wide receiver Terrell Owens October 25th workout might not have impressed any NFL teams but it impressed the rest of us mortals The general consensus on ESPN seemed to be that the aged rabble rousing Owens wasn t going to attract much interest from NFL teams given his sordid history and recent injury but that he had a bright future as an underwear model I concur Doing sit ups in the driveway does a body good 30 Tiki Barber s Fiance Takes It off for Maxim There isn t much to like about retired Giants running back Tiki Barber He bailed early on a successful NFL career for a pathetically short lived career in broadcasting the highlight of which was dumping his pregnant with twins wife of a decade for a 23 year old NBC intern Traci Lynn Johnson is quite a sight but it says a lot about Tiki Barber that the best thing about him is a home wrecking 23 year old bimbo with bad enough taste in men to marry Tiki Barber 29 Josefine Oqvist Jersey Swap During the 2011 FIFA Women s World Cup Swedish soccer stunner Josefine Oqvist made hearts race when she made her way to the stands to swap jerseys with a lucky fan after Sweden defeated North Korea 1 0 Oqvist even let him knock her a little kiss on the cheek before heading back to the field to rejoin her teammates I guess we know what story that guy will be recounting to his great grand children 28 Brooklyn Decker Lindsey Vonn at the ESPYs Even in micro mini dresses on their own Lindsey Vonn and Brooklyn Decker would have struggled to pull the spotlight from Brian Wilson s spandex tuxedo However when you put the two of them together it s a totally different story When Andy Roddick s better half presented Lindsey Vonn the 2011 ESPY for Best Female Athlete the two embraced in their micro minis and it was the only time all night that there wasn t a single pair of eyes on the spandex tuxedo 27 Mark Sanchez in GQ The jury is still out on his football acumen but this much we know New York Jets quarterback Mark Sanchez is a handsome man a very handsome man Sanchize s handsomeness obviously hasn t gone unnoticed by the editors of GQ magazine who featured him on the cover of the August 2011 issue Sanchize was featured shirtless on the football field shirtless at the beach with a model and shirtless in a bathtub flexing the guns Someone at GQ knows what the ladies like that s for sure 26 Cowboys Cheerleader Kelsi Gets the Game Ball In mid November 2011 Bills wide receiver David Nelson made quite a big production of giving a game ball and a hug to his girlfriend Dallas Cowboys Cheerleader Kelsi Reich after scoring Buffalo s first touchdown of the game Sure the Cowboys were killing the Bills but Nelson wouldn t let a little something like losing badly prevent his romantic grand gesture 25 Minka Kelly Kisses Co Star Rachel Taylor Yankees slugger Derek Jeter s on again allegedly girlfriend actress Minka Kelly doesn t need to show up somewhere with her man to get people talking In mid October 2011 a then Jeterless Kelly sent the Internet abuzz when she was photographed in a less than platonic looking smooch with then Charlie s Angels co star Rachael Taylor Nobody knows why the pair were kissing but there was speculation that it was an attempt to help boost the ratings of their now cancelled show Well it didn t work and although the uninspired CBS reboot was temporary this photo is forever 24 Rob Ryan s Inspiration Is Diora Baird In September 2011 Dallas Cowboys defensive coordinator Rob Ryan proved he wasn t the only Ryan brother with a lust for life and other things Ryan was spotted on the sidelines with a defensive play chart that included a photo of Guess model Diora Baird for additional inspiration It seems to be working The Cowboys won that game and now look to be on pace to win their division and maybe even compete in the playoffs That is if Romo doesn t pull a Romo 23 Eagles Cheerleader Stephanie Smith at Home with Esquire Like former WWE Diva Stacy Keibler Philadelphia Eagles Cheerleader Stephanie Smith was among those featured in Esquire s Me in My Place series Smith modeled her cheerleading uniform baked cupcakes in her underwear and lounged seductively on her bed for the camera Ms Stephanie revealed that that she s a P90X fanatic who likes to dance in the mirror with the blinds open when she s putting on her uniform just to make sure she looks her best Wondering if all that is authentic Smith who has good taste in sitcoms had this to say They re real and they re spectacular Indeed 22 Rafael Nadal for Armani Emporio Armani sure knows how to hire people who look amazing in underwear Soccer players David Beckham with wife Victoria and Cristiano Ronaldo have both shilled in their skivvies for Armani in the past In 2011 tennis superstar Rafael Nadal and seductive sexpot actress Meghan Fox joined the Armani army and produced some of the hottest ads yet Which is obviously no small feat if you ve seen Beckham s ads in particular 21 ESPN s Annual Body Issue ESPN The Magazine s annual Body Issue should really be released in December because the whole thing feels like Christmas for anyone who likes sports and or nudity The 2011 Body Issue didn t disappoint and had a little something for everyone Rams running back Stephen Jackson and L A Clippers forward Blake Griffin for the ladies and other interested parties and U S women s soccer Hope Solo U S women s gymnast Alicia Sacramone and snowboarder Gretchen Bleiler for the gents and other interested parties 20 Arianny Celeste Is a Virgin In a July 2011 interview with RawVegas tv 26 year old UFC Ring Girl Arianny Celeste said that despite her super sexy image she s still a virgin Hey I don t know if it s true but I certainly can t prove it s not Either way though Celeste who has appeared in Maxim FHM and Playboy knows how to get your attention 19 LSU s Tyrann Mathieu Makes Defense Sexy What s that lame saying Offense is sexy but defense wins championships Something like that although I m sure the shockingly smug and suddenly unlikable Aaron Rodgers would disagree A Rodge opinions aside there s no denying that nothing put asses in the seats like a high flying high scoring offense That s only because LSU s standout sophomore corner Tyrann The Honey Badger Mathieu is still playing in the Bayou It s impossible to predict how Mathieu will perform in the NFL but after two seasons with the Tigers he s got a lot of people believing he s got at least the potential to become one of the biggest play makers in the game 18 Abbey Clancy in Esquire UK British model Abbey Clancy is the wife of footballer Peter Crouch who plays for Stoke City in the Barclay s Premier League Clancy s July 2011 feature in Esquire U K was everything everything you d expect and more from one of the hottest WAGs on the planet Clancy was featured in various positions and states of undress on a lucky motorcycle and in the interview she revealed that she was a horrifically ugly child exaggerated eve roll who dreams of becoming a Victoria s Secret Angel My guess is she isn t the only one who d like to see that happen 17 LFL Bench Clearing Brawl As a woman I can t truly understand the appeal of the catfight All I know is that judging from television and movies men seem to really enjoy them Well if an ordinary run of the mill catfight interests you then a bench clearing brawl between two football teams of lingerie clad women should really interest you In December 2010 the LFL s Tampa Bay Breeze and now defunct Miami Caliente engaged in a bench clearling brawl that trumps that was more entertaining than any brawl Josh Beckett has ever manically beaned his way into It was suggested the whole thing might have been staged but my question is Who cares 16 Erin Andrews Shills for Reebok ESPN anchor and national treasure Erin Andrews deal with Reebok was short lived thanks to the network s ridiculous rules about corporate sponsorships Although perhaps they re only ridiculous when Andrews is involved because nobody wants to see Tony Kornheiser or Skip Bayless anymore than they already have to Andrews deal with Reebok might be a thing of the past but at least we ll have her sexy photo shoot to remember it by 15 Irina Shayk Lands SI Cover The Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Edition might be a little tame for people but we have it to thank for introducing us to some of the hottest women of the last two decades Tyra Banks Heidi Klum Rebecca Romijn Marisa Miller Bar Rafaeli and Brooklyn Decker have all graced the cover On the 2011 cover we were treated to 25 year old Russian Goddess Irina Shayk who you may recognize as the arm candy of footballer Cristiano Ronaldo Here s hoping SI buys American in 2012 and gives the people what they want More Kate Upton to clarify I m not being anti Russian models I m being pro Kate Upton which reminds me 14 Kate Upton Joins Twitter In April 2011 Sport Illustrated Swimsuit Edition s hottest bikini babe and Victoria s Secrets sexiest angel Kate Upton joined Twitter Her sudden appearance on the social networking site is a testament to the vast glories of the information age Upton s top priority was figuring out how to make her background picture something that properly highlighted her boobs She s carried that can do spirit with her and if Upton is someone who appeals to you physically check out her Twitter gallery You owe me big time for this information 13 Vancouver Riots Couple Kiss Vancouver Canucks fans took their team s Game 7 loss to the Boston Bruins in the Stanley Cup finals hard very hard We all know that Canadians love hockey like Germans love David Hasselhoff but the apocalyptic riots that befell Vancouver in the wake of the loss surprised most of us The couple kissing on the street amongst the riots became a global sensation and the photo will likely live on as one of the most iconic photos in sports history 12 Cam Newton s Heisman Smile Embroiled in controversy Auburn s superstar quarterback Cam Newton gave a relatively awkward speech when he accepted the Heisman trophy in December 2010 Today the NCAA pay for play allegations are behind him they found no major violations and nobody even remembers his speech What they do remember is Cam Newton s enthusiasm and his megawatt smile mostly because his rookie success in the NFL is a welcome weekly reminder So far the eye catching Newton has said and done all the right things and is one of the easiest guys in the NFL to root for I for one am looking forward to seeing a lot more of Newton in the future a lot more 11 Paulina Gretzky s Twitter Scandal Apparently The Great One s that s Wayne Gretzky to you hockey neophytes daughter Paulina like her mother Janet has her sights set on some kind of career in the spotlight Unfortunately for the Gretzky s but fortunately for us like many 22 year olds Paulina is under the mistaken impression that the best way to achieve her dreams is by postings hundreds of slutty pictures of herself on the Internet Apparently No 99 had a conversation with his little girl about sullying the family name on Twitter because most of the questionable pictures have been removed Naturally they remain easily accessible on countless sites like BroBible for your viewing pleasure 10 A Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders 2011 Calendar I haven t seen the swimsuit calendar of every cheerleader squad in the NFL although I have seen most but something tells me none of them would disappoint That being said you can count on the Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders to knock it out of the park without fail year after year Which is a credit to those aging monsters who run the show down there but since I think it s possible to be great without snickering about cankles or rolling your eyes because a 19 year old girl who wears a size four is too thick they can choke on their credit 10 B Miami Dolphins Cheerleader Swimsuit Fashion Show Most if not all cheerleader squads in the NFL produce their own swimsuit calendar that can be purchased at the games and online As if the calendar weren t gift enough many squads promote their annual calendar with an annual swimsuit fashion show It should come as no surprise that the best bikini centric blowout comes courtesy of the Miami Dolphins Cheerleaders Living in a tropical year round bikini heaven gives them an innate advantage 9 Angela Rypien Not Mark Is the QB in the Family Remember Washington Redskins unlikely Super Bowl winning quarterback Mark Rypien Me either but he exists and this ridiculously hot vision in neon green is his daughter Angela Rypien is the standout rookie quarterback of the LFL s Seattle Mist Angela is a breakout star in the league who if good prevails over evil we ll probably be seeing a lot more of in the future Oh and I m in no position to make this happen but wouldn t she and Cam Newton or Mark Barkley make an adorable fairytale football couple 8 Michelle Beadle Wants to Get What In August 2011 Deadspin com reported on rumors circulating about the behavior of ESPN s Michelle Beadle following the ESPY awards in Los Angeles Beadle didn t dispute that she stopped at a umber of late night parties that night but she does dispute everything else in the report According to the source a sloppy drunk Beadle and a few girlfriends were hanging with Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers when she loudly announced I just wanna get f ed Beadle was allegedly rebuffed by the Super Bowl MVP who was linked to Erin Andrews earlier in the year and had to settle for his teammate Clay Matthews True or not it sounds like quite a night 7 German National Women s Soccer Team in Playboy In order to promote the 2011 FIFA Women s World Cup and dispel the stereotype that female athletes are butch the German National Women s Soccer team posed for German Playboy in June 2011 Well there is probably happy medium between butch and Playmate but their point is well taken and I m not one to mess with perfection 6 Rob Gronkowski Spends Bye Week with Bibi Jones New England Patriots superstar tight end Rob Gronkowski lives a substantially more awesome life than you Gronk has an impressive job washboard abs a bloated bank account and he spent his bye week visiting friends at the University of Arizona his alma mater in Tucson Apparently among his friends in Tucson the city of which he is king is the sexually adventurous Bibi Jones When Ms Jones tweeted a photo of herself donning the jersey of a shirtless and smiling Gronk it became a full on scandal 5 Arianny Celeste Sells Bud Light Lime In June 2011 UFC s virginal Ring Girl Arianny Celeste appeared in this advertisement for Budweiser s disgusting citrus travesty Bud Light Lime Thankfully they aren t even pretending to sell beer in this commercial which features a near naked Celeste sucking on limes and squeezing them on herself while explaining that she likes things physical Listen Bud Light Lime knows it s disgusting but Arianny Celeste likes a man that can go more than one round and opting for Bud Light Lime instead of Jack Daniels on the rocks makes it more likely that you ll be able satisfy her if given the opportunity Even though you won t be given the opportunity 4 Larissa Riquelme Promises to Bare It All for Paraguay We all know that soccer isn t entirely embraced in the United States despite allegedly being the most popular sport on the planet I ve got two words that can change all that Larissa Riquelme In July 2011 Paraguay superfan Larissa Riquelme garnered global attention when she vowed to strip naked again apparently if Paraguay won the Copa America Her beloved Paraguay made it to the finals but unfortunately lost 3 0 to Uruguay who obviously thought nothing of ruining it for the rest of us Some people are so selfish Well here s hoping she s still looking for a reason to take it all off during the 2014 World Cup 3 Jim Harbaugh s Machismo Giants head coach Jim Harbaugh s belly flashing chest bumping exchange with his players after beating the previously undefeated Detroit led to a handshake with a little too much gusto for Lions head coach Jim Schwartz s liking Now we don t know how much juice Harbaugh put into that handshake but either he shakes hands with the manly force of a hungry crocodile or Schwartz is kind of a baby Maybe it s a little of both The media called the whole exchange childish stupid and inappropriate Whatever jerks I called it hot And I m not embarrassed to confess that I looked up Jim Harbaugh s marital status just to rule out that he hasn t been waiting his whole life for a broad like me 2 Seriously Hot Broads Seriously Talkin Sports It was less than a decade ago that women for the most part were relegated to largely useless roles in the sports media There were a couple of ballers doing their thing but do you even want to remember a world before Erin Andrews Thanks to ambition and the internet Andrews isn t the only game in town anymore Miami s Kavita Channe is just one of countless broads building a name for themselves outside the confines of a major television network A Miami sports radio fixture Channe a University of Florida alum has built a massive and devoted sports following on Twitter Facebook and YouTube Channe has interviewed Miami megastars like LeBron James and even brought you a hilarious Baseball Wives spoof six months before it premiered on VH1 1 Kate Upton Does the Dougie Few things in life are guaranteed to make me smile every time without fail than an athlete doing the Dougie Dallas Cowboy Dez Bryant Philadelphia Eagle DeSean Jackson and the man who did it best Washington Wizard John Wall have all captivated with their moves I even enjoyed the rendition of the Detroit Lion s corn fed mid western frat boy backup quarterback Drew Stanton Their moves are boss but you will never see a sexier Dougie than that of busty model Kate Upton It s starts out slow but becomes almost hypnotic as it goes on By the end of this magical performance you don t know which way is up rankings\/list, multiple sports, b\/r swagger, pop culture, partners guilty pleasures so 2011 was kind of a downer overall, right? a presidential primary, an nba lockout and a wicked lame bcs rematch in ncaa football. no thank you... so 2011 was kind of a downer overall, right? a presidential primary, an

Suck So Hard how qr codes work and why they suck so hard"",""body"":""QR codes are a technology that desperately wants our attention They appear everywhere from supermarket shelves and magazines to hiking trails and tombstones Never heard of a QR code You re looking at one right now Scan the image at the top of this article and it ll open a link to the mobile version of this article Very meta That s a pretty typical example of a QR code occasionally useful but often pointless Either way these plucky information sources are routinely ignored and usually reviled Here s where the next big thing in scannable coding went so horribly wrong QR Quick Response code is the trademark name for the two dimensional barcode system It was originally invented in 1994 by Denso Wave a Toyota subsidiary as a way to track vehicles as they were assembled and to scan components at high speeds While Denso Wave does hold the patent on the technology it has granted free licence on it going so far as to publish the spec online and allowing anyone to use it The conventional one dimensional barcodes used on virtually every consumer product are mechanically scanned That is they re read by physically bouncing a narrow beam of light onto the code which can be interpreted using the pattern of light reflected off the white gaps between the lines QR codes on the other hand can not only hold 100 times more data than 1D barcodes they can also be digitally scanned The block of smaller black and white squares is read by a smart phone s image sensor then interpreted by the system processor The three large squares act as alignment targets while the smaller square in the remaining corner acts to normalize the size and angle of the shot As you can see from the image on the left the blue strips near the alignment squares contain formatting information and the remaining yellow area is the actual data that s converted into binary code and checked for errors before being displayed The encoded data can be interpreted as one of four primary modes numeric alphanumeric byte binary and Kanji Other forms of data can also be displayed with the appropriate extensions As QR code technology evolved it began to contain more and more information The initial version was 21 x 27 pixels and held just 4 characters worth of data The most recent version is 177 pixels square and it holds 1852 characters enough for a few pages of information QR codes have long since expanded their usefulness beyond the automotive industry They re used today in everything from inventory tracking to shipping and logistics to online ticketing Fandango is a big fan Bands put them on fliers to link to their videos on YouTube or set reminders for upcoming shows Businesses use it to put Google Maps directions on a business card automatically load a web page or send a text email to the company helpline One enterprising wildlife refuge in Sanibel Florida has installed the codes on signs along hiking trails and programmed them with information about the local fauna So with all these new and interesting ways to use this burgeoning technology which coincidentally got a boost recently when it was announced that the iPhone 5 would not include the competing NFC system why aren t they more popular According to Comscore as of December 2011 only 20 percent of Americans 16 percent of Canadians and 12 percent of Spanish and UK smartphone owners actually use QR codes at all In part it s because advertisers have attached themselves to QR like it s a golden teat The rate of QR codes in magazine ads rose by five percent last year from 3 6 to 8 4 percent according to marketing firm Nellymoser You can find QR codes in stores billboards subway ads posters and magazines It s an effort to convey the appearance of being tech savvy Thaddeus Kromelis a strategist at WPP s WPPGY Blue State Digital told Business Insider Unfortunately most consumers aren t buying it Advertisers are looking at every way possible that they can connect with consumers said Forrester Research analyst Patti Freeman Evans Consumers aren t saying Oh I really want to be able to connect with companies and brands As such the primary use of QR codes last year was actually for product scanning either to recieve further information on a product or a coupon reward and was primarily done at home This is due largely to the inherent limitations that QR suffers from The system needs a steady hand to take the shot the proper QR app to interpret it and a data connection to load the webpage and content So when advertisers put QR codes on freeway billboards or on subway ads where there is little cell reception and expect users to then go through the trouble of installing an app just to be taken to the desktop version of the corporate website it s little wonder why nobody bothers with it Thick headed advertisers aren t the only drawbacks to QR codes though The codes can also be used to transmit malicious code in what s known as attagging Since anyone can create the codes it s easy to write a bit of malware put it in a QR code and slap that code over a legitimate tag Some sap scans the bad code and if his permissions are set too loosely the code could give itself access to everything from the camera to the contacts to the GPS data Or it could connect to an infection site loaded with browser exploits The phone an become part of a bot net or be used to send unauthorized texts hackers in Russia once used QR to commandeer phones to send 6 international SMS messages And of course there s the open source issue great for developers but not so terrific for the end users just trying to read the things There are multitudes of QR readers in every app store and all of them offer a slightly different user experience None of the big three iOS Android or WP7 offer a native app Plus there is no dominant brand of reader So users are stuck picking QR readers essentially at random hoping for the best All that hassle to hopefully look at a company s website or possibly have your security compromised It s a combination of factors that doesn t do much to spur confidence in the technology or enhance its adoption rate Wikipedia Forbes QR Me Statesman 2D Code Business Insider Yellow Image Swetake giz explains, qr codes, scanners, readers, malware, shopping, marketing, core, gizmodo qr codes are a

released Apple made a big show of promoting its Facetime app and for good reason It s a valuable service that lets iPhone owners make a more personal connection to the people they care about while on the go Still for all of Facetime s blessings there s one glaring flaw with the app it only works with other iPhones While that s not necessarily a huge problem in and of itself it begins to exacerbate itself a bit when you hear news about Android becoming the largest and fastest growing smartphone operating system This means that as consumers increasingly move away from so called dumbphones it s grows less and less likely that you ll be able to video chat with your new friend on your phone Luckily there are a huge number of cross platform smartphone apps that allow you to work your way around this problem Here s a list of our INSERT NUMBER favourite apps available on both iOS as well as Android Tango A free video chat service that functions much like Apple s ballyhooed Facetime However aside from allowing iPhone owners to talk to Android users it also doesn t restrict you to using WiFi for calls While video chat on 3g can admittedly be rather spotty at times it still manage to serve its purpose fantastically while not confining you to any specific platform WhatsApp If there s one thing that all mobile phone users can agree on it s that text messaging rates are inordinately high Combat the problem by grabbing the WhatsApp messenger from either the App Store or Android Market WhatsApp allows those who own the application to send text messages to each other without the usual SMS charges And with additional availability for both BlackBerry as well as Nokia s Symbian you ll find yourself with a much larger ecosystem of users Facebook Probably goes without saying but having a Facebook account is almost a necessity in this day and age Though the Android Facebook application initially lagged behind its iPhone counterpart in terms of functionality it s made a dramatic comeback and both are now fully featured Tweetdeck It s usually the case that the official version of apps is the best but Tweetdeck is one of the few exceptions to this rule Tweetdeck s columnar layout makes sorting through direct messages mentions and of course the users you follow a simple and intuitive process Furthermore with the ability to add additional custom columns Tweetdeck is almost essential for those who use more than one Twitter account Spotify Pandora This of course is heavily dependent on where you happen to live but both streaming music services allow you to listen to music on the go without needing to have all your mp3s on your phone Spotify in particular allows you to connect to Facebook and share your favourite tracks and playlists with your friends making for a more interactive listening experience Google Goggles A fairly handy do it all type app Google Goggles core functionality revolves around allowing you to take a picture of a product with your phone s camera which is then scanned and turned into a link that allows you to see the specific name of the product However recent updates have included other functionality such as allowing one to scan QR codes as well as solve Sudoku puzzles in case you decided you needed that for whatever reason Dropbox So you ve got your computer at home a netbook for travel a tablet to use on the go as well as your smartphone with you at all times Chances are this means you ve also got a lot of files scattered about that are a pain to sync Dropbox allows you to conveniently access your data all in one place and access your files from any device Kindle Let s face it there are going to be times when you re waiting in queue that you simply get tired of playing Angry Birds for the 100th time For those instances it s always nice to keep some reading material handy The Kindle app for both Android and iOS gives you access to Amazon s library of new and popular releases as well as thousands of free books Its syncing ability also allows you to save your page your bookmarks and your notes across other devices including of course the actual Kindle itself Shazam So you re walking through your favourite store and you hear a catchy song but have no idea what the name of it is No problem simply launch Shazam hold your phone up and it ll do all the work After a short period in which the app analyzes the song being played it ll give you both the artist and title allowing you to find it much more easily than you would ve been able to otherwise Bump Probably unnecessary but it doesn t take away from how awesome the app is Bump allows users to exchange pictures or contact information like phone numbers and email addresses simply by opening the app and bumping fists with one another So Apple s App Store may admittedly be a bit more refined at the moment but it s clear that there are a good number of quality apps available for Android phones as well Part of the mass appeal of smartphones is the ability to augment your device s core functionality with a number of programs that allow for functionality your phone wouldn t have otherwise So no matter what device you ve got

most of us in the fitness and iron game Mr Bale s physique and screen presence had to be perfect for this summer s biggest blockbuster Here s how he did it Article Summary Bale had to reveal an impressive physique for The Dark Knight Christian only had a few weeks to get the job done before filming This workout will force your muscles to grow lose fat be healthy The Dark Knight Workout It isn t hard to want the life of a celebrity While most of them may have fame and fortune a ripped physique is still not the norm No matter the line of work attaining a lean physique still takes considerable work and mental fortitude I often laugh when I hear people say that the only reason celebrities look great is because they have more money personal trainers and time Well in some cases these things can often spawn a worse physique Having a lot of time and money on your hands can lead to over eating laziness and being complacent We as humans all have the same physiology and therefore can all benefit from the same techniques to attain the leanness we all envy In his upcoming epic movie The Dark Knight Hollywood superstar Christian Bale had to reveal an impressive physique After all he had to fit in a skin tight suit maintain six pack abs and still have a screen presence of being tough Not easy to do Surprisingly though his workouts and nutrition program mirrored that of most of us in the fitness and iron game Mr Bale s physique and screen presence had to be perfect for this summer s biggest blockbuster Here s how he did it Nutrition The goal of this summers Dark Knight was to have a very lean yet muscular physique similar to the goal of many of us on Bodybuilding com Hence his diet was set up to take advantage of the anabolic window to support muscle growth and limit fat gains To do this most of his carbohydrates were consumed in the morning upon wakening and after his workout Times when glycogen would be at it s lowest and absorption of nutrients would support muscle rather than fat gains His choice of carbohydrates would mostly consist of those that were low on the glycemic index and would therefore keep insulin levels and energy more stable Workouts Christian Bale is known for his ability to transform his physique for various roles For the Machinist he dropped to double digits on the scale In fact many were worried that he wouldn t be able to gain enough weight to play the role of the dark knight Mr Bale not only pulled it off but brought forth a physique that many would be lucky to develop over years of training For anybody to accomplish this they must possess desire and knowledge It s one thing to really want a great body but knowing how is just as important Great Body On A Tight Schedule So he only had a few weeks to get the job done and we can all relate Granted we may not make 20 million dollars for attending our next reunion in ripped shape but at least we can hold our head high and know we truly accomplished something While it isn t advised to cut or gain weight quickly it can be done within reason Many don t advocate this because it is d mn near impossible Dropping weight fast often leads to considerable muscle loss and a scrawny physique Gaining weight fast often leads to little muscle gains and a lot of fat So if we are playing against the odds and trying to get in great shape fast we better be 100 on the money Workout Setup To make significant changes in your physique it helps to have been there before Muscle Memory is one our greatest allies If you were muscular and lean before it is much easier to get there again hence another reason to get in great shape even if it s just once Christian Bale had been there before and knew his body possessed the ability to become lean and muscular The Dark Knights Objective And Goals Attain A Lean Muscular Physique In Less Than 8 weeks Do not sacrifice muscle for weight loss obtain a balance and watch the mirror No cheating on nutrition must be 100 perfect Treat each set and rep like it s our last Each cardio session must be planned and pushed through The Nutrition Plan Consume just enough calories to gain or preserve muscle while still losing fat Keep insulin to an absolute minimum knowing it is most valuable at breakfast and post workout Consume most carbohydrates in the form of green vegetables and low on the GI scale Rolled Oats Ezekiel Bread Green VegetablesProtein must be high at least 1 25 g lbs of bodyweight The Training Plan Train to failure on each set this will activate the most high threshold fibers to initiate growth Favor more volume than intensity as the extra time in the gym will burn more calories Over training is not a major concern we have a movie to make Reps in the 6 12 range with various tactics such as supersets and drop sets Use mostly compound exercises to stimulate the most muscle Train 5 days per week with cardio 7 days per week Workout Setup This will hold true for all workout days Set 1 Setup 4 Sets x 6 8 10 12 Rest 2 Minutes Between Sets The high threshold fast twitch fibers will be activated right away with the heavy weights The higher reps that follow will stimulate other more endurance oriented fibers Wake up the fibers early and reap the rewards later All weights should be chosen accordingly so that the reps listed are able to be performed As an example don t pick a weight you could get 12 reps with for your 4 rep set Also don t forget to warm up thoroughly Set 2 Setup 3 Sets Of 10 12 reps Rest 1 Minute Between Sets Now since we have awoken the giant we will continue to punish you with higher reps and more intensity Now we are going to do 3 sets of 10 12 reps with one minute of rest in between Again pick an appropriate weight For example the first set pick a weight that will allow 12 reps but maybe you could have gotten 14 This way by the third set you will really have to struggle to get 10 Set 3 Setup Two Supersets One Drop Set Rest Just Long Enough To Catch Your Breath And Feel Your Arms Sorry no pain no gain We have a deadline here and you don t want to look good You have to look great Two supersets and one drop set will finish off this body part 30 minutes after each lifting session on a treadmill bike or elliptical This will definitely continue the fat burning as your lifting session will significantly reduce your stored glycogen which makes fat that much easier to tap into Don t forget to consume a fast digesting carbohydrate and protein source after your cardio session to start the rebuilding process Also I highly recommend taking in 10 15 g of BCAA and glutamine in the morning upon awakening and after your weight session to preserve muscle and protect your health The Dark Knight Workouts Monday Chest Triceps Tuesday Biceps Wednesday Quads Hamstrings Thursday Lats MidBack Friday Shoulders Saturday Sunday 30 Minutes Cardio Each Day Nutrition Plan Meal 1 Meal 2 Meal 3 Meal 4 After Workout But Before Cardio Meal 5 Immediately After Cardio Session Meal 6 Bedtime Conclusion There you have it The ultimate guide to your Dark Knight workout Undoubtedly Christian Bale had to train this intensely to transform his body for this summer s most anticipated movie This workout will force your muscles to change and give you just enough protein and carbohydrates to build muscle lose fat and keep you healthy If you can get through six weeks

will amplify flavor and add moisture We will use aromatics in the cavity instead of a stuffing This will add flavor to the meat and prevent it from overcooking We will use a rub of oil and aromatic herbs that bastes and flavors under the skin as well as on top of it We will oil the outside of the skin for crispiness We will not truss or tie the bird We will let the entire surface brown even the armpits because nobody wants rubbery wings But we will prevent the wings and drumsticks from burning with foil We will not cook it breast side down as has become popular Liquid just does not move through muscle tissue that far And where would the moisture come from there s just a flap of skin above the breast when it is upside down My method makes the breasts more moist We will roast the bird in a humid aromatic smoky atmosphere to hold in moisture and add flavor We will not place the bird in a roasting pan We want convection air to flow all around it We will use a digital probe to monitor the bird s temp to make sure it is not overcooked not the plastic popup that is set too high and is unreliable We will remove it from the heat at 160 F instead of 170 F as most recipes recommend and it still will be safe We will slice the breast across the grain so it is more tender We will crown it with an amazing thin gravy that soaks into the meat rather than sitting on top of it The result will be a magnificent looking dark mahogany avian with incredibly tender and juicy meat delicately and elegantly flavored with savory herbs and seductive smoke You don t need a fancy smoker to make a killer smoked turkey This is my 20 year old Weber Genesis I have removed the grates The bird sits on a wire rack above a drip pan filled with a flavorful gravy which is really a turkey soup and the drip pan sits right on the flavor bars On the left is a disposable aluminum loaf pan with apple wood chips I have covered the tips of the wings and drums with foil to keep them from burning The foil is removed later You can even follow this recipe and make a killer bird indoors by just leaving out the wood Some other recipes for a great turkey and tuber dinnerDon t sweat the timing with a faux cambro Here is a guideline of a timeline for a 15 20 pound bird Remember if you want to serve a 15 20 pound bird Thursday at say 5 30 p m you will need to begin refrigerator defrosting the previous Sunday Click here for more on thawing the bird At 325 F 15 pound bird will be done in about 3 to 3 5 hours and a 20 pound bird should take a total of about 4 to 4 5 hours depending on how well you control the oven temp and how often you open the lid If you are unsure about what temp your cooker will settle in at and variables like the ambient temperature sun and wind can really muck things up I recommend you put the bird on early and when the probe says it is 160 F put the bird into a faux Cambro a plastic beer cooler to keep the bird warm until dinner time While in the faux cambro the meat temp will rise at first to about 165 F and then it will slowly cool But it will take several hours to get dangerously cool below 150 F if it is a good tight box The faux cambro is especially handy if you need to take the bird over the river and through the woods to grandmother s house If you have space in the oven you can cover the bird with foil to keep in moisture and put the bird in the oven at 155 F until you are ready to serve But you probably won t have room in the oven because Aunt Annie is bringing her famous sweet potatoes with marshmallows and then there s the string bean casserole and the stuffing etc So get that cooler cleaned up Practice makes perfect Rather than waiting for the big night to do a turkey why not do one a few weeks in advance to get your technique down Leftover smoked turkey is good grub Stuffing on the side Alas we will not be stuffing this bird Why 1 An unstuffed cavity allows smoke and flavor into the meat from the inside 2 Stuffing pulls flavor and juices out of the meat 3 Cooking a large cold mass of stuffing so the juices are safe to eat means that the meat will be overcooked If you must have stuffing and if you re having me over you better have stuffing then cook it on the side And why not cook it in muffin pans so each individual serving will brown all around making lots of crunchy bits for everyone If you want your stuffing wet and juicy there will be lots of gravy from this recipe to pour over it 4 Stuffing sticks to the ribs and if you break down the carcass and make stock the next day see below the bread in the stuffing will make the stock cloudier than usual Want a good recipe Try David Rosengarten s Classic Bread Butter and Sage Stuffing Turkey t ts If you don t want to do a whole bird you can get turkey t ts They come in two forms a double breast cut off the bird with bone in or de boned and rolled together and held tight with a mesh If they are de boned cooking time may even be longer than for the whole bird because the meat is thicker Personally I prefer to cook the whole bird and savor the leftover smoked turkey on salads and sandwiches Secrets of crispy skin 1 Pat the bird dry and leave it in the fridge a few hours to dry even more 2 Oil the skin with vegetable oil or clarified butter just before cooking Regular butter has water in it and that can soften the skin 3 Cook at 300 F or more 4 Keep the door closed and the heat in That means no basting Basting liquids do not penetrate the skin Basting is not necessary for good color The heat and smoke will take care of that If you must baste use oil but nothing water based which just gets the skin soggy cools the meat and slows the cooking Best plan Just lay off the basting Do you hear me all you masterbasters 6 For crispy skin you must get the timing right The bird must come off the cooker rest for no more than 15 30 minutes and then be carved Using the faux cambro method makes the skin soft Read this article for more on the subject of basting Is pink meat safe Yes it can be according to the US Department of Agriculture USDA if it has been cooked to a temperature of 165 F in the center of the breast According to the USDA The color of cooked meat and poultry is not always a sure sign of its degree of doneness Only by using a food thermometer can one accurately determine that a meat has reached a safe temperature Turkey fresh pork ground beef or veal can remain pink even after cooking to temperatures of 160 F and higher The meat of smoked turkey is always pink We take the bird off at 160 F and it will rise to 165 F even if it is off the cooker In addition smoked meat turns pink due to a chemical reaction with the combustion gases and the smoke and the meat Click here for more on what are ideal meat temps Click here for more on meat science and the thermodynamics of cooking What you need to know about turkeys You may have to order your turkey a week or two in advance so get crackin now Pick a bird that is labeled natural no additives or minimally processed If you plan to brine it and I recommend brining do not buy a turkey that says basted or self basting or enhanced They have salty fluid injected into the meat This adds some flavor and as much as 15 weight which adds profit They do not work as well as the brining process Now beware it is getting hard to find a bird that has not been injected There are a lot of turkey farmers who will sell you a fresh bird just look for them and order early Some butchers have a relationship with local farmers and they ll take orders for fresh birds You can usually order an unpumped bird from Whole Foods Buy a fresh turkey only if you are certain it has been killed recently I would rather have a frozen bird than a fresh bird that has been sitting around for a couple of weeks There is not much of a flavor difference between fresh and frozen birds Whatever you do don t brine an enhanced bird with an altered brine with less salt The salt concentration is needed to prevent microbial growth and a less salty brine could suck moisture out of the meat Some people believe hens are slightly more tender than toms but because most turkeys are slaughtered when young usually 4 to 5 months old there is no noticeable difference according to Cook s Illustrated magazine Remember raw turkey is potentially dangerous It is likely to be full of microbes This is unavoidable in most grocery fowl So you must thoroughly wash your hands tools counter top sink platters and anything that contacts the uncooked bird Click here to read more about food safety How big a bird Several variables to consider Do you want leftovers Male to female ratio How many children How many side dishes When does the game start As a rule of thumb 1 pound per person will be more than enough when you subtract bones and shrinkage I usually go 2 pounds per person so those who want leftovers can take some And I have fun with turkey leftovers watch this space for some of my recommendations If you have a large crowd it is better to cook two 12 pounders than one 24 pounder if you have the room Here s why The breast on a turkey is the thickest piece of meat and the last to finish cooking The bigger the bird the thicker the meat the longer it takes to cook the center of the breast to proper doneness By the time it is done other parts are overcooked and the outer parts of the breast are dry Cooking two birds will not take longer than cooking one if you get the cooker up to the proper temp Special tools 1 Grill or smoker A smoker is nice for this recipe but it can be done just as well on a normal charcoal or gas grill In fact it can be done indoors without the smoke and still turn out a killer meal For info on buying a smoker or grill as well as the internet s best buying guide click here If you are using a gas grill a charcoal grill or an offset smoker you need a setup like the picture here 2 Plastic drink cooler You will need a well insulated plastic drink cooler large enough to hold the bird and cover it with brine Do not use a styrofoam cooler It could give the bird an off flavor and you ll never get it clean when you re done This cooler can also be used when the bird is cooked to keep it warm until you are ready to carve I call it a faux Cambro click the link for more info on the concept 3 Roasting pan and rack You ll need a roasting pan for the gravy and rack to hold the bird above the pan The pan should have at least 3 quart capacity and be large enough to fit under the bird in the cooker as in this picture The rack should cover the pan and hold the bird a few inches above above the liquid If you are using a bullet shaped water smoker like a Weber Smokey Mountain click the link for setup info you can use the smoker s water pan for the gravy 4 Thermometer with a probe A digital thermometer with a probe that can be inserted into the bird and a cord that can run from the probe to the outside of the smoker so you can monitor the temperature while the bird is cooking Click here for a buying guide to thermometers Do not trust the popup thermometer that comes with the bird It is set to pop at too high a temperature and will guarantee an overcooked bird 5 Smoking wood You ll need about half a cup of smoke wood That s all you need Turkey loves smoke but too much can ruin it in a hurry I usually use chunks of apple wood but if you do not have chunks you can use chips If you cannot find apple try alder peach or oak Try to avoid mesquite and hickory They ll work but I think they re a bit too strong for delicate lean meats Click here for more on smoking woods 6 Lifters You ll need turkey lifters or bear paws If you don t want another gadget in the kitchen you can lift a turkey by sticking the handles of two wooden spoons into the cavity Ingredients For the bird 1 turkey 15 to 20 pounds Read my article on thawing meat 1 large onion cut in quarters 1 2 cup smoking wood 2 large sprigs of fresh sage or thyme each about 3 4 long optional For the gravyThe gravy goes in the pan under the bird while it cooks It puts aromatic humidity into the atmosphere helping to keep the bird moist and captures drippings making an incredibly flavorful broth Don t skip this 3 quarts water1 cup apple juice2 onions skin on ends removed chopped into quarters2 medium carrots peeled and cut into 2 inch lengths1 stalk of celery cut into 2 inch lengths1 tablespoon dried sage leaves crumbled do not use sage powder 1 tablespoon dried thymetrimmings from the bird neck tail excess skin and fat Optional You can replace some of the water with chicken stock vegetable stock or a bottle of a white wine I usually get a white wine from the closeout bin of the local liquor store Oxidized white wine is fine just don t get anything that has turned to vinegar And no red wine I have occasionally added mushrooms to the gravy too You can substitute a small handful of celery leaves for the celery stalk This is a good way to get rid of them For the brine2 gallons water3 gallons crushed ice or 3 5 gallons of ice cubes 7 2 cups pickling salt or 4 cups table salt or 6 cups kosher salt 2 cups brown sugar6 tablespoons garlic powder not garlic salt 4 tablespoons crushed black pepper2 5 pound bags ice in water tight bags For the wet rub1 teaspoon dried crushed sage1 teaspoon dried crushed thyme1 4 cup of vegetable oil or olive oil Preparing the gravy This gravy is not the thick and pastey stuff made with flour that sits on top of the meat This gravy is a thin flavorful broth that penetrates the meat making it incredibly moist 1 After the bird has thawed open the bag it came in and pour the juices into a large non reactive pot Put the neck in the pot too 2 Remove the gizzard heart and liver They will not be used for the gravy Cook and feed the gizzard and heart to the dog Freeze the liver and save it along with your chicken and duck livers until you have enough to make a nice pat\u00e9 Be sure to check for innards in both the big rear cavity and in the smaller front cavity under the skin flap 3 Remove the tail and trim excess skin and fat from around both cavities front and rear and put it in the pot along with the neck and the juices 4 If there is a plastic pop up thermometer remove and discard it If you rely on it you will be eating cardboard 5 Add the rest of the gravy ingredients to the pot and bring it to a simmer for about 15 minutes Cool and refrigerate We will use it in the drip pan during cooking Preparing the brine A brine is a mix of salt and water and in some cases flavorings When meat is put into a brine the salt induces the meat to allow in moisture and the flavoring without making the meat too salty If your turkey says it has been enhanced or basted or is self basting that usually means it has a salty solution injected into it Never brine a bird that has been injected I know from first hand experience and my wife won t let me forget it Click here to learn more about brines and how they work If your bird has been enhanced just skip the brining stage You will brine the meat in a plastic insulated cooler If the cooler is large you may need to scale up the brine recipe to make sure the bird is submerged You can use something like a large stainless steel pot but the ice will melt quickly if it doesn t fit in the fridge and you ll need to change it regularly Do not use an aluminum pot I can react with the salt and create off flavors If you only have an aluminum pot line it with a food safe plastic bag such as the Ziploc XL But the best tool by far is an insulated plastic cooler You can use it later when the bird is done Just clean it thoroughly with hot soapy water first You may see brine recipes elsewhere that call for adding chicken stock vegetable stock apple juice and all kinds of herbs and spices Don t waste your money They barely impact the flavor You ll have plenty of flavor without them especially from the gravy 1 Mix all the dry ingredients in 1 gallon of warm water and stir until salt and sugar dissolve I recommend pickling salt because it has no additives and because it dissolves easily but plain table salt is fine You can boil the water if necessary to help dissolve the salt and sugar Pour the brine into the cooler and add 1 gallon of cold water and 3 gallons of crushed ice or 3 5 gallons of ice cubes cubes take up more volume than water 2 Put the bird into the brine breast side the large humped side down Clean the plastic bags of ice thoroughly with soap and water and rinse them completely People often walk on them in the delivery truck Put the bags of ice inside another plastic bag if necessary to make sure they don t leak and dilute the brine Put one bag of ice in with the bird now and store the other in the freezer You will use it in about 6 hours when the first bag is mostly melted Move the bird around and get the air bubble out of the cavity Most of the brine will enter the meat through the cavity since the skin is like a water resistant jacket Let the bird swim in the brine for up to 12 hours in a refrigerator or other cool place Keep the brine under 40 F adding more ice when necessary If you can see unmelted ice it is probably below 40 F 3 After no more than 12 hours remove the bird rinse it thoroughly inside and out so the exterior will not be too salty and pat dry Do not leave it in the brine too long Rinsing is crucial 4 While the skin is soft and elastic insert your fingers carefully between the skin and the meat and loosen it so later you can put the baste there You can work from both the front and rear and reach down to the thighs and wings 5 Place the bird on a rack in the refrigerator for 3 hours or more so the skin will dry You can even leave it there overnight This will help make the skin crispy Preparing the rub Most folks know that a rub is a mix of spices but there is also such a thing as a wet rub a mix of spices and oil That s what we ll be using to penetrate the meat with flavor and crisp the skin Click here for more about rubs Optional Sometimes if the sage in the garden hasn t frozen I ll put a little olive oil or butter and whole fresh sage leaves under the skin instead of a wet rub and use the wet rub on the outside of the skin only If you look at the picture of the finished bird up close you can see the sage leaves under the skin They taste great 1 After the bird has emerged from the brine and after the skin has had a chance to dry a bit mix the herbs with the oil and gently push it under the skin and on top of the breast Spread it out and work it as far down to the thighs as possible 2 Spread the remaining rub on top of the skin The oil will help it brown and make it crispy If you run out rub the exterior with olive oil or vegetable oil and sprinkle with pepper sage and thyme Skip the salt The brine has salted the meat perfectly Cooking the bird 1 Crank your cooker up to 325 F or as close as possible We do not need to cook turkey low and slow like ribs or other fatty meats with lots of connective tissue At 325 F 15 pound bird will be done in about 3 to 3 5 hours and a 20 pound bird should take about 4 to 4 5 hours depending on how well you control the oven temp and how often you open the lid If you have a smoker that doesn t get that hot you will need to cook longer Just remember every time you open the lid you lose a lot of heat and moisture and add about 15 minutes to the cooking time so keep the lid on If you re lookin you ain t cookin 2 Clean the grate you will cook the bird on before you put the drip pan in Pour the gravy into the drip pan put it onto the cooker so the liquid will preheat and take a load off the cooker when you put the bird on later 3 If you have a digital thermometer with a probe on a wire insert the probe into the front of the breast so the tip is in the center of the thickest part of the breast being careful not to touch the ribs or keel bone That s usually right where the popup thermometer was 4 Put the onion you cut into quarters and stuff it into the cavity If you wish put some fresh herbs in there too I like sage and thyme Take four pieces of aluminum foil each about 8 square and coat one side with vegetable oil so it won t stick Cover the wings and drumstick tips with the foil That will keep them from burning You ll take the foil off after an hour so the skin will brown and crisp Do not pin or tie the wings up against the body of the bird or fold the wing tips underneath as some cookbooks say or the skin will not brown and crisp there and what s the point of wings if they re not crisp 5 If you re using a gas grill wrap the wood in aluminum foil poke holes in the packet so the smoke can escape and put the wood beneath the grates as close to the fire as possible On a charcoal cooker the wood goes right on the coals no foil needed Put the rack on top of the drip pan and the bird on the rack breast side up Some people like to cook breast side down because they think fat and juices will percolate down and keep the breast moist but juices can t travel through that much flesh and besides it s not necessary for this bird It s been brined It will be plenty moist Do not put the bird into a roasting pan We want her sitting out so she can get smoke and moisture penetration Close the lid and don t open it for an hour Every time you open the cooker you let out heat and moisture and you delay dinner That means no basting Not if you want crispy skin 6 After an hour open the cooker and remove the aluminum foil Do not baste If you don t have a thermometer on a wire already in the breast check the temperature with a good probe thermometer by inserting the probe into the deepest part of the breast near where the popup was Push the tip past the center and slowly pull it out The lowest temp is the one to watch If necessary add a quart of boiling water to the gravy pan Make sure there are at least 3 inches in the pan at all times Do not let the onions and other solids in the pan burn While you re under the hood if you are using charcoal add another 15 to 20 chunks every hour Tilt the bird and drain any liquid from the cavity into the gravy pan Repeat this step every hour Do not add more wood The worst thing you can do is oveersmoke Go easy If you fear that the bird is moving too slowly and you are having trouble keeping the temp up to 325 F preheat your indoor oven to 325 to 350 F and move the bird and the gravy inside It will be fine this way Most of the smoke flavor is already in the bird 7 When the internal temp of the breast passes 160 F drain the cavity into the gravy Many cookbooks say you should take it up to 170 F or 180 F but that temp is guaranteed to produce meat as dry as cardboard If the temp is 160 F in the center of the breast with an accurate digital thermometer when you take it off it will rise another 5 F if you let it rest about 15 minutes At 165 F in the breast it is safe according to the United States Department of Agriculture USDA At that temp the thighs are likely to be at 170 F or higher They can handle it because they are juicier and slightly more fatty Don t worry if it is slightly pink Smoke can turn meat pink and according to USDA slight pink is OK see the sidebar above Use turkey lifters or bear paws or clean oven mitts or two wooden spoons with the handles stuck into the cavity to move the bird to a large pan or platter with sides that will contain the copious juices when you cut it A cutting board will overflow Let the bird rest at least 15 minutes before you start carving Resting allows the pressure built up inside the meat to ease up a bit and the juices will not come gushing out If you have to travel over the river and through the woods wrap the bird in foil and clean towels and put it in a very clean beer cooler perhaps the one you used to hold it when brining I call this a faux Cambro The temp will rise about 5 F at first and an hour later the temp will drop only 5 to 10 F Just don t let it drop below 145 F 8 While the meat is resting carefully remove the gravy pan from the cooker Pour the gravy through a strainer into a large saucepan Taste it It should be rich and flavorful If you find it too weak unlikely bring it to a boil and cook it down a bit Do not thicken with flour or cornstarch Starches will prevent it from penetrating the meat I have been known to pour it into a coffee thermos to keep it warm When you are ready to serve the bird transfer some to a gravy boat or serving bowl Leftover gravy can be frozen It is killer as a soup base or for cooking rice risotto or couscous 9 If you absolutely must have the thick kind of gravy you had as a kid take about 4 tablespoons of the fat you skimmed off and put it in a saucepan over medium heat with 4 tablespoons of flour Whisk the flour until it is smooth and keep whisking until the flour starts to brown about 3 minutes This is called a roux and the browning cooks the flour and kills the pasty flavor Slowly pour in 2 cups of the gravy whisking as you pour and keep whisking until it thickens It shouldn t need any seasoning but you can add salt if necessary Carving 1 After the meat has rested you can begin to carve I prefer an electric knife but any carving knife will do just make sure it is sharp 2 You will need two platters one for the white meat and one for the dark meat Why is there a difference in color and flavor According to the USDA The pink red or white coloration of meat is due primarily to oxygen storing myoglobin which is located in the muscle cells and retains the oxygen brought by the blood until the cells need it To some extent oxygen use can be related to the bird s general level of activity muscles that are exercised frequently and strenuously such as the legs need more oxygen and they have a greater storage capacity than muscles needing little oxygen Turkeys do a lot of standing around but little if any flying so their wing and breast muscles are white their legs dark The major reason that poultry meat is much lighter in color than beef is that it is dramatically lower in myoglobin Also as an animal becomes older its myoglobin content usually increases Turkeys today are young 4 5 months old at the time of slaughter First the dark meat Take a paper towel and grab the top of a drumstick and bend it until the joint between it and the thigh is visible Sever the joint and remove the leg Then hold the thigh with the paper towel and cut through the skin that connects it to the body Bend the thigh back to find the hip joint Cut through the joint removing the thigh Repeat with the other leg and thigh You can serve the thigh whole or you can remove the meat from the bone and slice it if there are a lot of people who want dark meat To do this flip the thigh skin side down and run your knife around the bone and under the bone until you can lift it out Then turn the thigh skin side up and cut it into slices 3 Now remove the wings by grabbing each wing with a paper towel bend it back to locate the shoulder joint and cut through it Arrange the wings thighs and drums on one platter and pour a little gravy over them 4 Now for the white meat The plan is to remove each breast from the carcass and then cut them into beautiful slices across the grain so it is more tender In the middle of the bird is the keel bone It separates the two breasts Cut down along the keel bone until the knife hits the rib cage Then tilt the knife and work along the rib cage until the breast falls away Lay it skin side up on a cutting board and slice it across the grain in 1 8 to 1 4 slices Fan the meat out prettily on the platter At right is a platter cooked by this recipe and and carved by reader Jeff Giberstein of Atlanta GA He says It was my world s record best turkey ever 5 Carve away as much of the remaining meat from the carcass as possible and put it on the appropriate platter Now pour a little gravy over the top of the meat enough to moisten it but not drown it Put the carcass in the fridge Don t leave it sitting at room temp for more than 30 minutes Now it s your turn Tell us about the most wonderful turkey you ever tasted All

gets bumped to the bottom of your list I know many people that complain about not having enough time to exercise I think they are lying to themselves The real problem is that they hate exercising so it will never be a priority I used to hate exercising too Going to the gym running and most forms of physical activity seemed dull and painful compared to most other ways I could spend my time But by not giving up and looking for a way I could enjoy working out I reversed this pattern Now I exercise 5 6 times per week and I hate not being able to go Here s some tips to make exercise something you actually want to do Make it a Habit Remove the thinking element If you can make exercise a habit then it becomes that much easier to go Here s some tips on making habits stick if you aren t sure where to start Get a Partner Get someone else to go to the gym with you Pick someone who is committed to their health Not only can you socialize with someone while you re there but you ll have a backup in case your motivation alone isn t enough to drag yourself out there Tune Your Challenge Level Here are two bad ways to start exercising Go out and run until your winded and dry heaving into a ditch Show up to the gym walk around don t do anything strenuous and go back home In one case you put the challenge level to high the other wasn t challenging at all Your goal is to set a workout routine that is challenging but not overwhelming Challenge is key to enjoyment Set Goals Not weight loss or muscle gain goals but fitness goals Set goals to beat your past records in distance ran push ups or chin ups you can do weight you can lift or degree you can stretch Fitness goals make the gym a game where you strive to beat your previous high score Get Past Your Comfort Zone So what if you aren t the most svelte or muscular person in the gym Self consciousness can be a big obstacle to enjoying your workout The key is to get used to it When you continue to show up you ll pay less attention to the people around you and more to your workout Experiment Don t stick with the same routine Mix it up and try different activities There are many different exercise routines you can follow or activities to try If you don t like lifting weights or running try sports martial arts or dancing Assuming that exercise needs to be pumping iron or jogging may limit you from finding something you would truly enjoy Music This shouldn t come as a surprise but music can enhance a workout I find running almost twice as enjoyable with music than without it Short Workouts Don t have time or enthusiasm to last an hour Just go for twenty or thirty minutes Shorter workouts can be better than longer ones if the intensity is higher and you become more focused as a result After an hour or two of exercise your body starts to go into a state where more exercise can actually reduce physical improvements Daily Challenges Make your workout into a game Sticking with the same type of exercises can get boring so mix it up by introducing an unusual workout challenge My gym partner and I have played a game that involves sit ups and a deck of cards or one workout day that involves different types of push ups If you aren t sure where to get ideas look through a magazine like Mens Fitness which usually features a variety of different workouts Reward Showing Up Not Weight Loss Some people have gotten the idea that they should reward themselves for losing weight or gaining muscle I disagree Instead I think you should reward showing up to the gym and exercising regularly There are many ways you can lose or gain weight in unhealthy fashions Rewarding exercise is rewarding your commitment to health Make Exercise Your Stress Relief I know many people that swear by using the gym to relieve stress Some of them will head to the gym because of a frustrating day even if it isn t on their schedule Exercising can be cathartic and release negative feelings if you get used to using it that way Then instead of avoiding the gym because of a stressful day it will be your reason to go Record Improvements Again I recommend recording fitness over body improvements Recording weight loss or muscle gain is a good idea but because of the way your metabolism functions it becomes increasingly harder to make weight changes as you go to the gym more regularly But fitness improvements can if you work on it continue to rise Keep a record of your strength endurance and flexibility so you can get pride in your accomplishments Make Time You can t say you don t have time to exercise Exercise improves your energy levels and mood which makes you more productive than any time lost Find your forty minutes somewhere in the day and make it a commitment Get up a bit earlier and go in the morning Or schedule it right after work before you settle down for the day Once you make time and make it a habit you ll actually want to exercise instead of just feeling you should is staying in shape always

learning good life we have received lots of mail with requests to clarify some of the complexities of sleep theory Many people have sleep problems and look for simple solutions applicable in their lives The present article attempts to explain the main reason for which healthy people may not be getting refreshing sleep sleep phase problems The article is accompanied by a simple freeware SleepChart application that may help you plan optimum sleep The cycle of sleep and waking is regulated by the body clock Body clock is located in the brain suprachiasmatic nucleus The clock has a period of about 24 hours During a single 24 hour day we have a period of 6 10 hours when we are very sleepy This is the time when we normally sleep During the remaining 14 18 hours we are usually awake however only a portion of that waking time is suitable for intellectual effort This period of maximum alertness may last as little as 2 6 hours We should plan our day in such a way that sleep comes at the time of maximum sleepiness while activities that demand maximum focus or creativity fall into the hours of maximum alertness It is very difficult and usually very unhealthy to force your body and your body clock to do what you wish It is far easier to do the opposite adapt your life to your body clock This article is intended to help you understand your body clock Delayed Sleep Phase Syndrome Delayed Sleep Phase Syndrome DSPS is a sleep disorder in which an individual finds it difficult to fall asleep late in the night and sleeps well into the afternoon if not awakened DSPS has only been characterized in 1982 but increasing data indicates that various degrees of DSPS occur with epidemic frequency esp among high school and university students DSPS individuals often like to keep on learning late into the night go to sleep very late for example 4 6 am and find it very hard to wake up early on a regular basis For example regular getting up at 7 am is a pure torture for individuals affected with DSPS They often fail to keep jobs that require them to perform early in the morning Very often they tend to split the day sleep into two components For example DSPS students often get a short sleep in the night wake up early with an alarm clock go to school where they are semi conscious and perform poorly get a solid nap after school and only late in the evening they regain vigor and their full mental powers DSPS students feel best after midnight when everyone else is asleep and they can focus on learning or other activities reading Internet watching TV computer games etc The main factors contributing to DSPS increased period of the body clock well above 25 hours reduced or increased sensitivity to factors that reset or advance body clock e g light activity stress etc electric lighting 24 hour economy and the resulting want to do more lifestyle A normal individual has a body clock running with a period slightly longer than 24 hours The clock is reset in the morning with activity and bright light Thus a normal individual easily adjusts to the standard day night cycle However DSPS individuals may have their clocks running periods long enough to find it hard to fit to 24 hours They also push their clocks ahead by activity late in the evening the process opposite to the morning reset synchronization DSPS individuals when given a chance to sleep when they want will tend to go to sleep later and later They will also wake up later and later DSPS people do not have problems with sleep if they sleep in their favorite hours Most mild DSPS cases can be remedied by changes in lifestyle but rarely are those changes painless to individuals affected with the condition If this description fits your problem you may diagnose the degree of your DSPS with SleepChart freeware at the bottom of this article Advanced Sleep Phase Syndrome Advanced Sleep Phase Syndrome ASPS is the opposite of DSPS People suffering from ASPS get very sleepy early in the evening and wake up very early in the night They circadian clock runs at less than 24 hour period As they constantly struggle to survive to a reasonable evening hour they sleep less awake early and experience increased tiredness during the day While a typical DSPS person is an adolescent student a typical ASPS person is a retiree or a middle age low stress tolerance woman The link between the age and sleep phase disorders may be related to aging itself however it may also be a result of lifestyle changes that come with age Correlates of sleep phase syndromes DSPS is more prevalent among adolescents while ASPS is more frequently observed in aging population DSPS is also by far more frequent among students programmers avid readers passionate artists computer game addicts etc ASPS seems more likely in individuals whose life is deprived of intense stimulation esp in the evening who meet fewer new challenges or who are not facing information overload stress etc Finally there is a complex relationship between DSPS ASPS and depression mania On one hand there may be a link between DSPS and manic personalities Anti depressants tend to increase the period of the body clock e g clorgyline imipramine On the other paradoxically DSPS individuals may be more likely to suffer from depression e g when in conditions of insomnia sleep deprivation resulting social problems etc Similarly low stress tolerance depressed individuals are more likely to suffer from ASPS Again when they are forced to adapt to normal life their symptoms of depression tend to weaken as sleep deprivation here counteracts depression The cause effect relationship between sleep phase disorders and mood disorders is complex Understanding it will contribute substantially to solving the escalating epidemic of sleep phase disorders It is not known which are the predominant underlying physiological factors that result in sleep phase disorders Family clusters show that genes may affect the length of the circadian period The lifestyle may affect levels of neurotransmitters and these could affect the period of the circadian clock Conversely the level of neurotransmitters may select for a specific lifestyle choices Age may have a direct impact on the clock circuits it may affect neurotransmitters or it can affect the lifestyle Last but not least sleep phase disorders will affect the mood and the levels of neurotransmitters in varying ways depending on whether free running sleep is used to remedy the disorder or wherever the individual attempts to fit a predetermined desirable sleep schedule How body regulates sleepiness There are two main mechanisms that regulate sleepiness One is the body clock and the other is the wake meter Body clock produces increased sleepiness every 24 hours The wake meter increases sleepiness with prolonged wakefulness i e the longer we do not sleep the sleepier we are In sleep literature these two mechanisms are called the circadian and homeostatic regulation of sleep Sleep control components circadian clock circadian clock produces sleepiness in 24 hour cycles homeostatic control wake meter measures the period in which we stay awake and triggers sleepiness after we stay up for long enough In DSPS or ASPS people there may exist a combination of several factors that make it harder to get good sleep Circadian clock runs in periods far different from 24 hours In DSPS people the circadian clock may be set to 25 26 hours In ASPS people it could be 23 hours Circadian clock is not sensitive to time resetting factors professionally termed zeitgebers Normal people reset their clock in the morning by light and activity In addition darkness and inactivity in the evening provide further clues for the clock Normal people with normal lifestyles can easily synchronize their sleep with the day night cycle Homeostatic wake meter shows changed sensitivity Sensitive wake meter will make people get tired very quickly after awakening Insensitive wake meter may make people tend to stay up for long Lifestyle has a dramatic effect on the behavior of the circadian and homeostatic sleep regulation mechanisms The same individual will show different sleep rhythm depending on such factors as using artificial lighting exercise level of stress timing of exciting activities napping diet climate changes in ambient temperature health status etc Examples of different sleeping rhythms Freeware SleepChart application that comes with this article bottom makes it possible to take a snapshot of sleep that graphically illustrates DSPS and ASPS rhythms 24 hour cycle Let us first consider an ideally synchronized 24 hour cycle In the picture below an octogenarian female wakes up naturally everyday around 3 00 3 30 am She sleeps 5 4 5 5 hours per day wakes up refreshed and is active throughout the day There is no synchronization with daylight as the waking hour falls into the period of darkness The cycle is synchronized by evening activities The subjects keeps in her mind a must go to sleep hour estimation that helps synchronize body clock with the time of day This psychological imprint is illustrated by a smooth change in the sleeping rhythm after the end of the daylight saving time on Sunday October 27 2002 the graph disregards DST so that the waking hour before the change is set at 2 00 2 30 am 24 hour cycle and stress Let us now consider the impact of stress on a well synchronized sleeping rhythm In the picture below a middle aged self employed male wakes up naturally everyday around 6 00 6 20 However on June 3 2003 a severe family problem throws the rhythm into chaos as evidenced by frequent nocturnal awakenings The rhythm returned to norm one month later as soon as the family conflict was resolved Asynchronous DSPS People suffering from DSPS find it difficult to synchronize with 24 hour clock In the picture below adolescent female with a mild DSPS suffers disintegration of the sleeping rhythm due to the failed efforts to synchronize with civilized life After the vacation period she begins in early September well synchronized with the rest of the world She wakes up between 6 30 and 10 00 However her body clock experiences continuous shift of optimum sleeping hours Soon she wakes up at 12 00 and begins a struggle against the further shift This results in disintegration of the sleep cycle short sleep periods e g 4 hours and frequent bouts of tiredness The presented software attempts to plot the hours of maximum natural sleepiness between red and brown lines Clearly the greatest disturbance in sleep occurs at the point where the natural rhythm departs furthest from the desired rhythm Mild DSPS cases are able to force the body clock to remain more or less in the desired bounds at the cost of constant struggle with sleepiness In more severe cases the circadian variables will run a 24 hour cycle and the individual will experience return to good sleep when free running variables align again with the desired sleep period In the graph below October 7 sleep period is almost aligning with the hours of maximum sleepiness resulting in good long refreshing sleep The average sleep length is 6 8 hours but it changes widely The average DSPS shift is difficult to determine due to the struggle with the natural rhythm however if is likely to be above 60 minutes as evidenced at the beginning of the graph Synchronous DSPS A graph below presents a sleep rhythm of a middle aged self employed male A very clear and regular DSPS pattern visible in the graph with a daily phase shift of 64 68 minutes Although sleeping in unnatural hours is certainly less beneficial healthwise than normal sleep for a DSPS patient free running sleep rhythm may by far less stressful and disruptive than any attempt to fit to standard lifestyle as shown above There have been cases in literature that documented people living along such shifting DSPS schedule for decades without major health side effects although some authors claim increased incidence of depression alcoholism or dependence on sedatives as a result of attempts to induce sleep A very reliable determinant of synchronous DSPS is the disruption of the link between the sleep onset hour and sleep duration As the duration of sleep is determined by the circadian phase well synchronized sleep schedule shows little variability in the sleep length 6 6 hours in the graph below In particular the sleep length is independent of the sleep onset hour Wherever the patient makes any attempt to synchronize with daylight or daylight related activities the link between sleep length and the onset hour will be reconstituted Mistakenly DSPS people are often called owls for their tendency to stay up late while ASPS people are called larks The graph below illustrates why this is a misnomer SleepChart A sleep charting and scheduling application You can download a freeware SleepChart application by clicking the link at the bottom of the article All you need to do in the program is to click the beginning and the end of the sleep block in the graph See the bottom of the display for exact hour points corresponding to the position of the mouse pointer If you set a wrong block select it by clicking and press Del SleepChart will attempt to approximate the circadian low that correlates with high sleepiness low temperature low ACTH high melatonin etc The underlying assumption is that you do not attempt to regulate your sleep This means that you do not wake up with an alarm clock or do not struggle against the sleepiness in the evening e g in order to delay sleep Currently there is no option that would let you eliminate artificially regulated sleep blocks This means that all attempts to modify your sleep schedule will fool the algorithm and your reading will be inaccurate or plain wrong It is also very important that you do not attempt to follow the circadian approximation when determining your optimum sleep hours This can result in a positive feedback of error and disintegration of the sleep cycle In other words errors in the graph may be amplified by your attempts to follow the graph At worst you could even self diagnose yourself with DSPS without actually suffering from the disorder Your only and sole go to sleep criterion should be rapidly increasing sleepiness You may use the graph to approximate the moment in which the readiness for sleep will occur You can also find it helpful in chronotherapy for ASPS or DSPS to make it easier to schedule your appointments without conflicting with your natural sleep rhythm Circadian graph in DSPS The circadian graph can help you better understand your sleep rhythm with its homeostatic and circadian components You will need a few months of data before the graph becomes meaningful In addition sleep boundary approximation lines are subject to substantial hysteresis If your lifestyle changes dramatically e g as a result of therapy you may need a few weeks for the approximation lines to align properly with data The circadian graph may then be more difficult to interpret Having separate data sets for such circumstances solves the problem Homeostatic The blue line corresponds with homeostatic sleepiness derived from the number of sleep blocks falling into a given hour of the waking day i e where zero refers to the hour of waking It roughly expresses your tiredness of wakefulness It also expresses your ability to fall asleep From the graph below you can read that the best chances of falling asleep fall around 18th hour of wakefulness assuming the graph is created without any artificial form of regulating sleep such as the alarm clock delaying sleep etc Your own optimum hour is naturally likely to differ check with SleepChart For most people the optimum hour falls into the range 16 20 If your graph looks like below and you wake up at 6 am you can conclude that you can best go to sleep shortly before midnight so that you could ensure you are in bed when the 18th hour of wakefulness comes up Some people take naps during the day Others don t The graph below is typical of a regular napper with the optimum nap time coming at 7 8 hour of wakefulness For example if you get up at 6 and your optimum nap time hits the 8th hour you should take a break around 14 and look for a secluded place for a few minutes of rest Naturally planning your lunch at 13 00 or so would be recommended too In the graph below 8 2 of sleep blocks begin in the 18th hour night sleep while another 8 1 begin in the 8th hour nap Non nappers will also experience a peak of sleepiness around the 7th hour even though their blue line graph will not show as prominent a bulge as below Circadian The red line corresponds with circadian sleepiness derived from the average length of sleep blocks started at a given hour of the waking day The graph indicates that even if you are able to initiate sleep during the day it will never last long Only after 14 hours of waking does the length of initiated sleep reach beyond 6 hours Maximum length of sleep can be achieved at 15th hour however this does not indicate this is the optimum hour of going to sleep If sleep is initiated too early it may or may not make it possible to catch on the full circadian low In other words we can wake up after just a couple of minutes of sleep and make it harder to fall asleep again due to instantly losing the homeostatic sleepiness In addition sleep initiated before the full circadian low does not seem to be of more value that slightly shorter sleep initiated a bit later e g as reflected by the subjective feeling of being refreshed in the morning or as measured polysomnographically The blue homeostatic line indicates that the sleep is more likely initiated at 18th hour while its average length is 6 5 hours If your graph is generated without attempts to artificially regulate sleep the second peak in the homeostatic curve may indicate your optimum hour of retirement The graph indicates that if you delay your sleep by one hour it will be shortened by 10 30 minutes It is possible that even this little shortening will affect your performance during the day If you advance your sleep by one hour it may be 10 30 minutes longer but its quality is not likely to increase In addition you run the risk of premature awakening breaks in sleep are ignored in the graph as this makes it easier to determine the circadian low Phase shift graph in DSPS The phase shift graph may be used by people suffering from ASPS and DSPS This graphs helps you see at what time you are likely to fall asleep for a given waking time For example in the graph below you can see that if your waking time comes at 7 am your best retirement hour blue line comes at 1 am However if you happen to wake up naturally at 11 am you are not likely to be ready for sleep before 5 am the next day The lighter pink and gray lines indicate the timing of a nap Again if you wake up at 7 am your best napping time might occur between 15 00 and 16 00 Remember Each individual will have a his or her own unique graph Moreover the graph will look differently if it is taken at times of work or at times of summer vacation It will be affected by stresses at work and at home It may even change when you move from one house to another or when you change the climate zone The graph will slope only for people with sleep phase problems and will accurately reflect your rhythm only if you adhere to free running sleep If you use an alarm clock this graph will be meaningless Download To download SleepChart a freeware sleep scheduling application for Windows click here Note for users of SuperMemo The algorithm used by SleepChart may be

weather Seattle s seen but the rain has finally begun to pour Just last week the cherry blossom trees stretched over my head in airy arching bloom but these days I have to duck to avoid the low branches laden with water Rain streaks down the windows bathing everything in a steely blue glow Umbrellas pop open like strange flowers when I walk outside In the mornings I wear red rain boots to class and in the evenings I fall asleep with the sound of rain in my hair I usually like this kind of weather but right now I can t stand it I m impatient for summer Impatient for dusty sidewalk chalk and melting Creamsicles but mostly for everything summer represents freedom relaxation No stress There are only two months to go but I don t think I can make myself wait I am tired of being patient I was patient all through Christmas break through the slush of February and the bitter chill of March Four months to go until college letters now two months one month to go Every day I switched between cheery confidence and desperate doubt It was like picking petals off a daisy they ll accept me they ll accept me not After months of waiting I finally received the last of my college decisions yesterday Of the eight schools I applied to I was accepted at five I was waitlisted at two very good universities But the only school I really wanted to go to the only school that could stir any passion in me at all was the last one to send out decisions The whole day was simply killing time I came home early and found that I had nothing to do I ate a banana I checked the mailbox it was empty I read a book of short stories without understanding any of them When the decision was available online my brain staggered I fumbled my way to the website and watched the page load with agonizing slowness I skimmed the first line and immediately knew The letter was brief polite encouraging It was brutal I read it read it again read it a third time with burning eyes Emotions passed through me like images on a strip of film horror confusion anger pain exhaustion heartache sorrow until I couldn t feel anything and laid face down on my bed overwhelmed Then I cried until my skin was as taut and my body was as hollow as a drum Have you ever felt like you ve been waiting patiently your whole life for something Something to validate all the work you ve done That s how I felt I m just so disappointed in myself and I can t help but feel wounded and unsure I curse the thought that my only outright rejection is the only one I can t take I keep thinking about what I could have done how I could have been better I know it s useless but you aren t rational when your heart is breaking I wish I could tell you that I ve moved on that the rain has cleared and I can smell summer around the bend and life is good Not yet It hasn t hit me but I know it will I didn t break down today as miserable as I felt every time I had to answer with that sad little smile Yep rejected When I came home I wanted to be in the kitchen And more than anything I wanted to write Typing out this post has been as good as Tylenol so far So much of my future is a mystery but there are some things I can be certain of Family good food and good company I can be sure of ice cold lemonade in the summer to come and spiced pumpkin pie in the autumn to follow I can be sure that luck will be with me wherever I go though it may not always seem like luck at first and that I will always have the patience to weather the wait These bars come together and bake in no time at all Instant gratification no patience required For now I can be grateful for that PS Happy birthday Grandma Love you These bars are really really good I m still feeling pretty down I could channel the hurt into a post but I don t really have the motivation to talk much about straight food The bars are soft with slightly crisp edges and a bit of chew The almond flavor is very good without being too overwhelming Everybody liked the

of an influence my childhood has had on my favourite flavours I grew up eating light sponges and regular yellow birthday cakes and I ve never had the least bit of interest in dense mud cakes I had a mug of hot milo before bed on most evenings and that obsession has never gone away Grape flavoured bubble tape and Grape Fanta has ensured my attachment to fake grape flavoured treats And the strip of strawberry in a tub of neapolitan ice cream has locked in my intense love for all things strawberry milk flavoured It may be artificial tasting to some people and it does tend to make me feel a little ill because I always have too much but strawberry ice cream strawberry flavoured milk and I m a little ashamed to admit it Macca s strawberry thickshakes are my weakness I can never resist it but I always regret it later Suze was telling me about the strawberry milk macarons from Cafe Cre Asion that sounded amazing and I really wanted to try With the combination of my strawberry flavoured milk weakness and Suze s encouraging Dooooo it s I had to test it out for myself I decided to combine it with another idea that I had for a cookie dough buttercream It seemed kind of appropriate I ve mentioned on this blog before that I have a serious weakness for choc chip cookies They are the one thing besides scones that I will whip up randomly just so I can be a total pig and I can never stop at one So this macaron flavour was full of all the things I was addicted to I thought about flavouring the macaron shells with Strawberry Nesquik to give it the strawberry milk flavour and some quick searching on the internet proved to me that it should work well see What The Fruitcake I also found a cookie dough buttercream from Annie Eat s which looked amazing and I had to try Oh my god THIS BUTTERCREAM IS ON ANOTHER LEVEL It is so good I insist that you try it immediately put it on a cupcake or just sit there are eat it straight out of the mixing bowl with a wooden spoon like I did And it has the added bonus of not having any raw egg in it It really tastes just like cookie dough I also used slightly salted butter to give it a little extra kick and mixed in small dark chocolate chip bits in the hope that it would help offset the super sweetness from the strawberry nesquik in the macaron shells I was actually surprised by how intense the flavour of strawberry came through in the macarons It was almost too strong it kind of overpowered the flavour of the cookie dough buttercream I m glad that I made sure to fill the macarons with a very thick layer of buttercream it really needed it and it tasted so good I ve also adjusted the amount of strawberry nesquik in the macarons because I think I used a little too much in my original recipe I d even consider adding even more salt to the buttercream because it still seemed a tad too sweet for my liking But you really can taste that strawberry milk flavour in these macarons It might not be everyone s favourite flavour but it s one of mine and I can t say no to it Strawberry Milk Macarons with Cookie Dough Buttercream buttercream recipe adapted from Annie Eats 100g aged egg whites you can use fresh eggs too just make sure they are room temperature I always use fresh these days and zap it in the microwave on defrost for 10 seconds 110g almond meal at room temperature and well sifted150g icing sugar50g Strawberry Nesquik50g caster sugarOptional 1 tsp powdered egg whites available from The Essential Ingredient helps to stabilise egg whites but is not necessaryFor the buttercream 115g 1 stick butter at room temperature I used slightly salted butter 1 4 cup light brown sugar packed1 cup sifted icing sugar1 3 cup all purpose flour1 4 tsp salt1 tbsp milk1 2 pure vanilla extract1 2 cup mini dark chocolate chips or very finely chopped dark chocolate I pulsed mine through the food processor to break it up Prepare the macarons Line two baking sheets with baking paper Place icing sugar and strawberry nesquik in food processor and pulse for a minute to remove any lumps Stir in almond meal and pulse for about 30 seconds to combine Place in a large mixing bowl and set aside Using an electric mixer beat egg whites and egg white powder in a medium mixing bowl until the egg white powder dissolves and it reaches soft peaks With the mixer on high speed gradually add sugar and then add food colouring and beat until it reaches stiff peaks Add meringue and to your dry mixture and mix quickly at first to break down the bubbles in the egg white you really want to beat all the large bubbles out of the mixture be rough then mix carefully as the dry mixture becomes incorporated and it starts to become shiny again Take care not to overmix the mixture should flow like lava and a streak of mixture spread over the surface of the rest of the mixture should disappear after about 30 seconds Place in a piping bag and pipe rounds of about 3 5cm diameter on baking sheets Leave to dry for about half an hour to an hour so that when you press the surface of one gently it does not break This will help prevent any cracking and help the feet to form on the macs Preheat your oven to 140 150 C 285 300 C depending on your oven Place on top of an overturned roasting tray or another baking sheet if your sheets are not professional grade for better heat distribution Bake for 15 20 minutes depending on the size of your shells Carefully test if the base of the shell is ready by gently lifting one and if it s still soft and sticking to the baking paper then it needs to bake for a few minutes longer Remove from the oven and cool on the tray for a few minutes then gently remove from the sheet and place on a wire rack to cool completely Prepare the icing beat together the butter and brown sugar a large mixing bowl with an electric mixer on high until creamy With the mixer on low gradually add sifted icing sugar then increase speed and beat until combined Beat in the flour and salt on low until just combined With the mixer still on low beat in the milk and vanilla extract until smooth and well blended Fold in mini chocolate chips until evenly distributed Sandwich macaron shells with a generous amount of buttercream I used about a tablespoon or so for each Refrigerate overnight in an airtight container to allow the flavour to mature Serve at room temperature

solidify Tim Tebow s back up Seriously what were you thinking 97 Selling the Sonics to Oklahoma City When the owner of Starbucks decided he didn t want a franchise anymore he suddenly saw a way to make up some of his debt Just like that the Sonics were sold to an Oklahoma City businessman and the Sonics were off to Oklahoma City to become another naturally occurring noise Sonics to Thunder okay Well not just like that there was the whole lawsuit thing over Key Arena but you know what I mean 96 Giving NFL Players Reality TV Series Not that these two weren t prima donnas anyway but now they have justification for it The horrible decision here is to let these guys have their own shows We get enough of them with their helmets off as it is 95 The End Zone Cell Phone Not only would this decision from Joe Horn cost him money it just seems like way too much trouble for five seconds of recognition Just find some poor fan steal their popcorn and pour it all over your face 94 Not Letting Blacks into MLB Sooner Could you imagine the level of play back then had the Negro Leagues joined forces with Major League Baseball We could be talking about new home run champions Gold Gloves and Silver Sluggers not to mention Cy Young winners 93 Joe Morgan as a Broadcasting Partner for Jon Miller Much respect to Jon Miller a legend in the booth with a silky smooth voice and electric emotion

Randy Johnson throwing at Larry Walker This is a silly rule and a horrible decision Ten better ideas come to mind in the blink of an eye 91 Naming Two Cities for the Same Team The idea here is to incorporate the team into a larger media market this time being the city of Los Angeles and surrounding areas The problem There is already a storied baseball franchise in Los Angeles and Angel Stadium isn t even in Los Angeles County 90 Dennis Rodman That s It Not much explanation needed here When this guy and sometimes girl is around steer clear bad decisions are sure to follow 89 Jeremy Giambi Didn t Slide Game 3 of the 2001 Division Series between the Oakland A s and the New York Yankees ended with sheer disappointment for Athletics fans Let s not forget the A s were up two games to none in the series Meanwhile they were only down one run in the seventh inning when Terrence Long hit one down the right field line and Jeremy Giambi rounded third It looked like he would score easily as the relay throw from the outfield hit no man s land near the first base line However Derek Jeter had sprinted across the field and in the same motion back hand flipped the ball to catcher Jorge Posada who applied the tag to the left leg of Giambi Had Giambi noticed what was happening he may have chosen to slide most likely tying the game The Yankees would come back to win the series and shouts of Slide Jeremy slide still ring through the Coliseum to this day 88 Johnnie Morton Tries Hand at MMA Johnnie Morton had a very successful NFL career as a wide receiver the majority of which he played with the Detroit Lions So when the San Francisco 49ers cut him after the 2005 season one might expect Morton to drift into the twilight Instead Morton decided to try MMA and in his first official fight he was knocked out after just 38 seconds by Bernard Ackah He had revealed just minutes before the fight that he had just a few months of MMA training under his belt Morton was denied his 100 000 purse after refusing to take the post fight drug test It was later discovered that Morton was on anabolic steroids Talk about the epitome of crash and burn 87 Brett Favre s Private Peep Show of His Privates While in the midst of a comeback from retirement with the New York Jets Brett Favre allegedly sent lewd pictures of himself to then Jets employee Jenn Sterger The investigation is ongoing but this is the worst decision Favre could make aside from coming back from retirement 86 Robin Ventura Charges Nolan Ryan Nolan Ryan built a career on intimidation and outright fire ball pitching When Robin Ventura charged the mound after Ryan threw at him the Hall of Fame pitcher turned into a Hall of Fame boxer pounding the head of Ventura with several blows Ventura learned his lesson the punishment for an ill advised rash decision 85 Michael Phelps Decides to Smoke Weed Win a record number of Gold Medals become the sports hero of an entire country then smoke weed Sounds like a solid summer 84 Maradona s Hand of God In what Argentinians refer to as the Hand of God goal Diego Maradona rises up between two defenders and punches the ball into the goal to help Argentina beat England in a 1986 World Cup quarterfinal The referee doesn t notice the hand ball and the goal stands Maradona gives the play its name later when he says the goal was scored partly by the hand of God and partly by the head of Maradona http espn go com page2 s list worstcalls 010730 html 83 Bug Selig Declares a Tie The 2002 MLB All Star Game was running out of pitchers when Commissioner Bud Selig declared the game a tie after 11 innings much to the displeasure of the crowd I want to take this opportunity to apologize to the fans commissioner Bud Selig said This is a very regrettable situation Yes yes it is Bud you as commissioner is quite a regrettable situation 82 Letting Ozzy Osbourne and Roseanne Barr Sing at a Baseball Game It s bad enough for Cubs fans to watch their beloved bears lose every year but don t rub salt in it by letting Ozzy and Roseanne anywhere near the microphone If you do the PA announcer might as well take a siesta because every fan s ears will be bleeding 81 Eastern Washington Decides To Get Red Turf If you color your turf anything but green you are a Boise State wannabe no matter what you say Having red turf instead of blue turf isn t original it isn t creative but it is certainly a publicity stunt Well done Eastern Washington football you are a celebrity for all the wrong reasons Maybe you and Heidi Montag can have a useless party together 80 The Tampa Bay Buccaneers Uniform Change After posting an article about lame jerseys click here The 20 Lamest Jerseys Anyone Can Own it was discovered that many Tampa Bay Bucs fans actually preferred the old school logo and orange jerseys over the new style Go figure Therefore changing to the new uniforms must have been a horrible decision right 79 Hull s 1999 Stanley Cup Finals Goal During Game 6 of the 1999 Stanley Cup Finals the Dallas Stars Brett Hull entered the goalie crease against Buffalo Sabres goalie Dominik Hasek Hull initially was denied by Hasek but tapped in the rebound for what would be the game and Stanley Cup winning goal Upon replay review it appeared Hull s left skate had entered the crease before he gained control of the puck but the goal would stand 78 Larry Bird Calls on Travis Best In Game 4 of the 2000 NBA Finals the Pacers were battling the Lakers in a tie game Bird called for Travis Best to enter the game to take on Shaquille O Neal in the final moments of regulation Best didn t win and neither did the Pacers losing in OT and suffering a debilitating loss to go down three games to one 77 Charles Barkley Gets Pulled Over While With Hooker Who Her That s my sister In all honesty officer I didn t see the stop sign while I was trying to hold her hair Last year Charles Barkley ran a stop sign failed a breathalyzer test and was charged with a DUI All in a days work for the Round Mound of Rebound 76 Cheering for McGwire Sosa and Bonds Who couldn t see this one coming Two guys looking awkwardly buff belting out home runs with seemingly minimal effort In all honesty it s hard to blame them Cubs fans just wanted a championship and Cardinals fans needed some excitement Still denial can be cruel and cheering for Barry Bonds and his abnormally large dome is hard to dismiss 75 Evander Holyfield Agrees to Fight Ear Munching Mike Tyson In 1997 Evander Holyfield was on top of the boxing world having already knocked Mike Tyson out cold in their original meeting What he didn t realize Tyson was on his way down and out with revenge on the brain for Holyfield Evander agreed to fight Tyson again and perhaps pride got in the way of better logic Tyson disgruntled with slowly losing to Holyfield again resorted to biting Holyfield s ears while removing a piece of one ear The fight was immediately ended by Mills Lane after the second bite signaling the start of a meltdown for Tyson and he s never recovered 74 Fan Throws Drink at Ron Artest Before Artest decided to conquer his aggression issues he was an Indiana Pacer playing the Detroit Pistons After leaving the court following a skirmish with Pistons players Artest was laying on a table beside the bench when a Pistons fan threw a beverage on him Artest jumped into the stands and starting running down Pistons fans in a rage The incident exploded into a brawl in the stands and one fan charged Artest and paid the price with a right hook to the face In hindsight You are an awful man Mr Artest probably would have sufficed 73 Celtics Select Len Bias with the Second Pick of the 1986 NBA Draft In the Celtics defense Len Bias was an All American in college and had skills to rival anyone else in the league at the time However a quick recon into his personal life would have revealed his drug addiction which ultimately cost Bias his life before ever stepping on an NBA court Bias would die from a cocaine overdose while celebrating the draft just two days after becoming a professional 72 Lions Head Coach Marty Mornhinweg Wins OT Coin Toss Chooses to Kick The Lions haven t been relevant since Barry Sanders and decisions like the one made by Marty Mornhinweg in 2001 may be the poster child of the era in Detroit The head coach entered overtime in a tie with the Chicago Bears won the coin toss and elected to kick His logic seems sound but in reality was quite twisted Having a kicker currently holding the NCAA record for longest kick 62 yards you wouldn t think a coach

Soviets and both teams began to walk off the court However the referees called the teams back putting three seconds back on the clock Three seconds was just enough time for the Soviets to throw the

right where he left off in the NFL Considered one of the best running backs in professional history Sanders would retire at the age of 31 citing the losing style of play in Detroit as too much to bear

broadcast operations unit to extend coverage of the game but were unable to reach them in time to delay the cut over or reinstate coverage before the game ended In the meantime the Raiders came back and scored 14 points winning 43 32 As a result no fans following the game on TV except for those on the West Coast were able to see Oakland s comeback live The complaints to the network indicated a new height of popularity for the game in the United States and ultimately led to changes to how football games would be broadcast in the future In a 2010 issue of TV Guide the cut to Heidi was ranked 5 on a list of TV s ten biggest blunders http en wikipedia org wiki Heidi Game 59 Kevin Riley Scrambles Inbounds With No Timeouts In 2007 Cal was mounting a furious comeback against the Oregon State

Blood Green spotted Mike Tyson on the streets of Harlem on Aug 23 1988 Green called out Tyson demanding a rematch He would get his wish as Tyson broke his hand on Green s face requiring five stitches

The NHL lockout of the 2004 05 season set out to demolish a proposed salary cap The players union decided they wouldn t play unless the idea was tossed out The result A TV contract with ESPN was lost

infamous photo The teenager allegedly phoned his father and asked for permission before running on to the field His father said it was probably not a good idea but as we all know he did it anyway

that is a little drastic For the United States government to get involved with steroids in the game of baseball The decision by the US Congress to investigate steroids in baseball was an unprecedented choice It is rare any issue in sports escalates to a hearing at this level What was the motive Was this really necessary Not likely 44 Twenty Teams Pass on Randy Moss In 1998 the focus of the NFL draft was the duel between quarterbacks Peyton Manning and Ryan Leaf for the No 1 overall pick So much buzz was generated by the QBs that everyone passed on a wide receiver with legal baggage However

mark on a dark era for the New York Knicks 39 Leon Lett Dives on Blocked Field Goal All the Cowboys had to do after blocking the potential game tying field goal from the Miami Dolphins was just let

technical fumble and a Dolphins victory 38 Miracle on Ice Russian Coach Benches Star Goalie After First Period A rag tag bunch of amateur hockey players were scraped together to represent the United States in the 1980 Winter Olympics in Lake Placid N Y The decision by Russian coach Viktor Tikhonov to pull star goalie Vladislov Tretiak may have been the key to the US defeating heavily favored Russia The hockey game would be remembered by the US for decades to come including a Hollywood depiction of the game 37 Tiger Woods Should I Do This Commercial Attempting to make a statement Tiger

Clemens Rafael Palmeiro Mark McGwire Etc Denying Steroid Use Things are so much harder when you try to cover up what everyone else already knows The decision to lie about steroids in front of the US

1999 Bill Parcells resigned as the head coach of the New York Jets paving the way for another member of the coaching staff to take over A press conference was set up to officially introduce Bill Belichick as Parcells successor However just minutes before Belichick s scheduled acceptance speech the coach scribbled a resignation note on a small piece of paper and handed it to team President Steve Gutman When it was time for Belichick to take the podium instead of an acceptance speech he delivered a half hour speech on why he would not accept the position citing differences and uncertainties with ownership Most see the real reason for his departure being the available head coaching position with the New England Patriots a team that had just fired Pete Carroll In fact the Jets filed for compensation with the league saying the Patriots did not have permission to speak to him and the league ruled the Patriots would have to give the Jets a first round pick in the 2000 NFL Draft Who knows how different the NFL would have been had Belichick stayed with the Jets He finished his first season with the Patriots at 5 11 but everyone knows where it went from there This decision started the countdown on a down period for the Jets who were left with no coaches and shattered thoughts of what could have been 33 No Salary Cap in Baseball Most professional leagues have a limit to the amount of money any one team is allowed to have and spend on players But in Major League Baseball there is no cap on team spending just luxury taxes for pennies on the dollar Anyone else tired of seeing this image The decision to not place a cap on team spending hits this list with ease 32 Tiki Barber Leaves Football for TV Career In 2006 the New York Giants all time leading rusher announced he was hanging up his spikes in favor of a microphone Tiki Barber called it quits in the NFL at the age of 31 vowing to make a name for himself off the field He became a correspondent for NBC s The Today Show The Giants missed out on years of further success the NFL missed out on a potential Hall of Fame candidate and Barber drifted into the unknown never to be the same 31 Randy Moss Returns to the Vikings From day one Randy Moss just didn t settle well with the Minnesota Vikings Chemistry is such an important aspect to team sports and Moss was destined to cause a violent reaction when he returned This season following being waived less than a month after returning Moss surfaced in reports alongside head coach Brad Childress exposing issues in the locker room and a nasty tirade aimed at the team caterer Childress nearly lost his job after it was revealed he waived Moss without consulting the team owner While the Vikings are struggling mightily in 2010 the last thing they needed was a distraction like Randy Moss 30 Ricky Williams Wears Wedding Dress on Cover of ESPN Magazine When Ditka drafted Williams the parody was instantaneous Ditka gave up all the Saints draft picks in 1999 to get him so a marriage was in order However Ricky Williams in a wedding dress just doesn t look right 29 Red Sox Manager McNamara Leaves Buckner in During 1986 World Series Game 6 kobe

unmistakable style the dream like quality of her designs and the luxurious fabrics she uses are good reasons for keeping an eye on this brand What is more important than fashion is the suggestions fashion is connected to Every designer has some themes and sources of inspiration for his her collection but Chapman s ability goes beyond this her dresses are like keys to enter a heavenly romantic dramatic and fairy like world where dreams come in the shape of tulle ruffles embroideries and feathers lighter than air I ve never attended a red carpet event and I will surely never do but if I had the chance to I would wear one of her creations just to realize how it feels like being a princess for a night The colour palette of this collection is based on a few bright colours China red royal blue hot pink and many neutral shades black white grey dusty baby blue cream and beige Only two dresses in China red were displayed which is a pity because I think this shade of red is perfect for such dramatic dresses The short one is strapless and has ruffles on the bodice and cascading from the waist line to the skirt The other dress lenght is just above the ankles very sexy lenght in my opinion and is a triumph of flat ruffles pleated tulle and floral appliques on the strapless bodice Feathers are a recurring leit motiv in Marchesa collections and they are the main features of many dresses of this collection Both the dresses above are decorated by white feathers but one is strapless while the other has an off the shoulder neckline Empire line accented by a black sash with bow I think these two white dresses are the ones which convince me less because they re a little bit confused in their embellishments The first is completely decorated by floral lace appliques while the second has a black lace insert on nude tulle on the bodice I love the pleated skirt and the beaded sheer underskirt though Empire line and feathers are a match made in heaven and make the white dress above so perfect The black and white taffeta and tulle ruffle dress is another staple in Marchesa collections You may have noticed this collection is much more relaxed and romantic than the spring summer 2010 one This time Chapman mixed the trademark elements of her style with the exotic and adventurous style of the Irish courtesan and dancer Lola Montez I think the tuxedo inspired dresses relate to that source The tuxedo black dress is so simple but is worn on a sheer top embroidered with a star motif stars recur in the collection the tuxedo short bolero is worn with a voluminous short ombre tulle skirt Pleated circles of black tulle are the elements which create the structure of the long dress they can be found in the skirt and on the strapless bodice The same fabric ruffled but not cut in circle characterizes the short dress with a nice star embellishment on the bodice Lace is one of the most romantic fabrics ever so I m not surprised to find it in this collection Chapman chose black lace for a strapless tube dress with slightly asymmetrical neckline and for a long siren shaped dress with sheer skirt This black tulle pleated dress doesn t convince much because the circular rose appliques are barely visible I would have left them out if I were Chapman This shot allows us to take a look at the make up and the hairstyle seen on the models The messy updos and half dos are a constant in Marchesa presentations and I think they re a lovely imperfect touch in contrast with impressive dresses Talia Shobrook did the make up of the models using Le M\u00e9tier de Beaut\u00e9 products I like the final result very light and glowing and I love those rhinestones in tear ducts I love when Chapman plays with the neutral tones of gold silver beige and powdery pink These colours are extremely refined and are perfect for making a statement dress more special than ever Liquid metal is the effect achieved by the intricate beadings which decorate the amazing dress on the left with a gold lace bodice accented by a bow on the shoulder Pleated tulle has been used in the second dress one of my favourite I love the way the skirt falls on the floor with a sea foam effect Two different tones of grey silver and dark grey characterize the short dresses above very much Marchesa with their delicate beadings and the silk and tulle ruffles Ribbons can often be found in Marchesa collections creating lovely ruffles and rosettes decorating both the dresses above One is short one shouldered and black while the other is floor long in a dusty shade of baby blue Feathers again but this time they come in a heavenly baby blue shade They embellish the skirt and the short sleeves of the dress with a sheer embroidered bodice and make precious the miniskirt worn with a tuxedo bolero Bright colours fuchsia and royal blue short lenghts and Paisley embroideries distinguish these two dresses one is short sleeved and has ruffles behind while the other has one shoulder and tiny ruffles on the bodice and on the miniskirt Christian Louboutin created the magnificent shoes that completed the collection These towering peep toe pumps in red and purple suede are Madame Butterfly The platform and the three bows are exquisite Lili Marlene and Marale are the names of the pumps and ankle boots above They are made special by glittering leather sheer inserts and cut outs Loubout are satin peep toe booties with platforms and diamante buttons reminiscent of Fifre ankle boots If you remember the spring summer 2010 collection I m sure you haven t forgotten the amazing flower painted tights seen on the models This year Chapman has brought things on a higher level tights are not only painted printed with rose decorations but also embellished by black beadings I hope some celebrities will wear them because they are absolutely stunning Ronfifi Supra are the suede over the knee boots with diamante buttons on the right a variation of the infamous Supra Fifre boots Canon are the peep toe booties on the left with satin platform black rhinestones on tulle and ruffles on the front The peep toe boots on the right are similar with satin platform and embroidered trims Can you see the tiny stars decorating the model s ankle Georgina Chapman has expanded her line with bags and jewellery some of which can be seen on the models The rings above created by the London based jeweller Garrard have central oval stones jade and pink coral inserted in diamond studded mountings I prefer jewels with a different vibe but these rings nicely complement the outfits on display What are your thoughts about this collection Which is your favourite piece I wonder who will be the first celebrity to choose one of my favourite dresses Source Like this Be the first to like

time when I was growing up and it s one of my favorites to make now Her recipe called for 2 tbs lemon juice added to the cream cheese and she just used cream cheese and either chives or green onions whatever she had on hand and she used pepper bacon for a little extra flavor And I LIKE it when the cream cheese comes out as sauce I love the sauce on rice and broccoli jennifer on March 25th 2012 I

been richer than Bill Gates He was the one that wrote the software that made the personal computer industry possible But he turned down a deal that would have changed everything because he was satisfied He died in a brawl Gary Kildall was an computer instructor at the U S Naval Postgraduate school in Monterey California In 1974 he saw an ad for an Intel processor and called the company to offer his services He was hired to write programming tools for the new Intel 4004 microprocessor When Intel introduced the 8008 and 8080 models he wrote a high level language for them that made the processor infinitely more useful You could give English like commands to the chip instead of talking in 0s and 1s When Intel developed the world s first floppy disk system the company decided not to sell it to the public Kildall asked if he could sell a version He invented the first DOS disk operating system and called it CP M or control program for microprocessors It could keep track of peripherals like a monitor or a disk drive His friends said he wrote it by himself effortlessly which showed his tremendous aptitude for writing computer code They also wondered why anybody would possibly want an operating system for a single user Kildall wasn t in it for the money but for the joy of being able to do it By the late 1970s CP M was running on over 500 000 computers It powered most of the computers of the time with the exception of the Apple which used not Intel chips and had it s own operating system This included Xerox Kaypro Kentucky Fried Computers Commodore Morrow Intel could have bought CP M for 20 000 but turned it down Along with his wife Dorothy Kildall started Intergalactic Digital Research Inc Intergalactic was later dropped They operated DRI out of an old Victorian home in Pacific Grove California Dorothy ran the business and Gary wrote the code At the time they started there was barely a market but soon they were selling thousands and making millions Gary Kildall liked the money and soon loaded up on the toys he could now afford airplanes speedboats motorcycles a stretch limo a Corvette A Rolls Royce Formula One racecars 2 Lamborghini Coutachs and a Ford pick up In 1980 IBM was secretly developing its own personal computer IBM did not believe the market was going to be that big so they decided to build it out of off the shelf parts and license an existing operating system CP M was the market standard so it was the obvious choice For some reason IBM mistakenly thought that CP M was owned by Microsoft Microsoft was then just a small company but the biggest provider of computer languages for microcomputers Microsoft didn t sell operating systems When IBM called Bill Gates told them that CP M wasn t his and directed them to Gary Kildall At one time Microsoft and Gary Kildall talked about merging their businessses but never did They tried to stay out of each other s specialty The next day the suits from IBM arrived in Pacific Grove for a meeting When they arrived Gary Kildall wasn t there The legend goes that Gary went flying too busy to talk to one of the biggest companies on earth The truth was that he had an appointment with one of his biggest customers and had flown that morning to see them He didn t think the meeting with IBM was going to be that big of a deal so he left his wife Dorothy to speak to them but he returned before the meeting was over Before the meeting started IBM handed Dorothy their standard one sided nondisclosure agreement The one sided document stated that the meeting taking place had never taken place and if it was proven that it had taken place anything IBM told DRI was confidential and anything DRI told IBM was not Dorothy refused to sign it and called her lawyer While waiting for the lawyer Gary showed up Gary didn t see the nondisclosure agreement as a big deal\u00ef so what if a big plodding company like IBM wanted to get into microcomputers he thought He would get a couple of hundred thousand dollars of business and that would be it So Gary signed the form The deal killer with IBM was that they wanted to buy CP M for a flat 200 000 plus a 10 royalty and they wanted to change the name to PC DOS Gary thought why should he do that He was earning millions CP M had strong brand name recognition and almost every PC except Apple was already using his operating system Why would he want to give that up Gary Kildall said NO IBM went back to Bill Gates to see if he could get Kildall to change his mind But Bill Gates game plan shifted He had given Gary Kildall first shot He wasn t going to give him a second Kildall was a better programmer Gates was a better businessman and saw the opportunity a lot clearer than Gary Kildall did Bill Gates greatest skill is to give people what they want Bill Gates didn t have an operating system to sell but told IBM he did Paul Allen Microsoft s co founder knew of where he could get an operating system just across town Tim Paterson owner of Seattle Computer Products had written Q DOS a close imitation of CP M Allen bought it from him for 50 000 He never mentioned that he was going to resell it to IBM Microsoft renamed it MS DOS then a made a deal with IBM IBM would pay them royalties for each copy and Microsoft would retain the ownership rights to the operating system This meant they could license MS DOS to anyone they wanted IBM PCs became the industry standard But they priced their machines too high which opened the door for IBM compatible computers or clones and Microsoft sold the operating system to every single one of them Gary Kildall was not happy when he found out about the Microsoft IBM deal He considered it theft when he learned how similar MS DOS was to CP M He was too easy going to sue and even if he did copyright laws would have made it hard for him to win A copyright only protects you from an outright copy not an imitation The threat of litigation caused IBM to give Kildall a deal IBM would offer CP M as an option along with MS DOS That was fine with him He believed the PC industry had room for two operating systems Competition was good he thought Just like there was room for two colas and three automakers IBM never told him they would let customers choose between MS DOS at 40 and CP M at 240 Of course who would pay 6 times more for the same thing Unlike Bill Gates Gary Kildall refused to enter the markets for word processing and spreadsheets because he thought it would be unethical to sell both the operating system and the other software Gary Kildall became a bitter man as the years went by He was haunted by the IBM deal It grated on him that Bill Gates was being given the credit for his invention He was constantly asked if he really went flying the day that IBM came to call He became distracted He and Dorothy divorced Gary Kildall spent most of his time traveling He sold his company DRI to Novell for 120 million in 1991 He hosted a television show for PBS about computers and wrote a 250 page tell all book that was never published He acknowledged that the book would probably be construed as sour grapes His son is afraid to have the book published to this day for fear of being sued by Bill Gates Shortly before midnight July 8 1994 Kildall walked into a bar wearing his Harley Davidson vest The bar was filled with a group of rough looking bikers No one is sure what happened but somehow he hit his head on something while falling backwards Was he in a fight Drunk Not even Kildall could remember He walked out of the bar on his own In two separate visits to the hospital that weekend no one found the bloodclot between his skull and brain Three days later he was dead at age 52 Related Posts "",""url"":""noodlescape the man

decision to keep your baby s diet as free of pesticides preservatives sweeteners and coloring agents is an admirable one though the idea of making your own baby food can be daunting In truth the process is quite a bit simpler that it seems on the surface Collect Your Supplies There are entire systems on the market designed specifically to facilitate making and storing baby food Packaged with a small processor and several cups that seal with screw on lids these collections are popular sellers among the new parent set However purchasing one of these systems isn t an absolute necessity you can use objects that are probably already in your kitchen You ll need a food processor or blender clean jars with tight fitting lids a rubber spatula a pot for cooking and a selection of organic fruits vegetables and legumes A hand powered food mill would also do the trick but tends to be more difficult to clean and time consuming than an electric blender or food processor If you do choose to purchase a baby food system it will come with everything you need to prepare fresh organic food for your little one except for the fruits and vegetables themselves Make Enough to Last Many parents who make their own organic baby food find that it s much easier to prepare an entire week s worth of food in one session rather than being forced to cook and puree each day It s not advised to prepare baby food with the intention of storing it for more than a week unless you plan to use a pressure canning method which is a time consuming and tricky process for inexperienced beginners You can also pour food into ice cube trays and freeze it transferring the cubes of pureed food to labeled jars after they ve frozen solid Homemade organic baby food preserved by using this method is good for up to one month in the freezer label it carefully and be sure to date each container Assemble Your Ingredients and Get Down to Business Wash vegetables and fruits thoroughly Peel and seed if necessary then roughly chop into chunks to reduce cooking times If you plan to include meats remove all skin and trim any fat Cook fruits and vegetables until they reach a soft tender consistency All meat should be completely well done red meats should have absolutely no remaining pinkness Don t add any sweetener salt or spices especially honey as babies under one year of age could contract botulism from ingesting honey even if it s used in baked or processed food Even pasteurized honey may contain botulinum spores that can lead to severe health complications for infants Eggs tomatoes and nuts should also be avoided during baby s first year as they are common food allergens Reactions can be quite severe in infants so parents are advised to wait until their child is a full year old before introducing these foods When the food has cooled use your blender or food processor to puree it the texture should depend upon your baby s age and dietary habits During the first few weeks of feeding your baby table food mixing a bit of breast milk or formula with the vegetables and fruits will cause it to take on a thinner more manageable consistency with familiar flavors As your infant becomes more accustomed to table food liquid can be gradually reduced and the texture of food can be chunkier You can also use water or liquid reserved from the cooking process to dilute the consistency of thick baby food Portion only as much food as you think your baby will eat in one sitting and do not reserve left over food for later feedings It s best to allow food to cool to room temperature before serving it as Baby s lips and mouth are very sensitive to heat The best and safest method of thawing frozen food is to allow the mixture to thaw naturally however it may be necessary to use a microwave from time to time Should you choose this method heat each cube of food for ten seconds before stirring thoroughly Repeat this process but only until food is just thawed and close to room temperature Careful stirring and testing eliminates hot pockets of food which are a common result of uneven heating in microwave ovens Be sure to carefully sterilize containers for storage and adhere to safe food handling practices your baby s immune system is far more fragile than your own placing her at a much higher risk for food borne illnesses This entry was posted on Saturday July 7th 2012

you had to pick just two words two little words that would empower you to change your life what would they be Mine would be I can You ve probably heard various personal development experts life coaches or self appointed gurus tell you not to say I can t But why exactly are those two little words I can so important What do they add up to and how do they work I Am Responsible For My Life The first word is I For me this emphasizes who has to do the changing However much we might like to blame someone else for the bits of our life we don t like the truth is that we ve got full responsibility for our life conditions Unless you re in an very extreme situation like being held prisoner there s no reason why you can t wake up one morning and decide to completely overhaul your life You can Quit your job Start that small business you ve always dreamt about Learn to play a musical instrument Take the first step in healing a broken relationship Start eating more healthily Be more active Don t ever put your hopes for change on someone else This sort of thinking looks like It s up to my partner to get a good job then I ll be better off financially or If only my mother would cook healthier food I wouldn t be overweight No one else can change you If you re heavily in debt overspending addicted to shopping and you win the lottery will you really turn your life around Or will you rapidly end up back where you started You might want to read 8 lottery winners who lost their millions for some food for thought here However difficult your circumstances poor health family problems money troubles you can start the process of change by looking at your response to events Stephen Covey author of The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People emphasises that it isn t a negative event itself that s a problem it s your response to it He explains that Our most difficult experiences become the crucibles that forge our character and develop the internal powers the freedom to handle difficult circumstances in the future and to inspire others to do so as well I Have the Ability to Act It s not enough to just think I when you want to make a change in your life though Simply accepting that you re responsible for your life doesn t necessarily empower you to change in fact it can be a bit depressing when you accept that the bits of your life you don t like are your responsibility rather than someone else s fault So the second word that I consider crucial for change is the word can With the tools of motivation self discipline and guidance from those more expert than us it s possible for us to accomplish anything we really set our minds to and set our hearts on How often have you said I can t or words to that effect Have you ever attempted a goal that you were saying I can t about I certainly haven t Here are a few popular I can t statements I can t sing write paint act I m trapped in this job relationship town situation I don t have any choices It would be impossible to quit I ll never succeed I can t lose weight I always fail Think about one of your I can t statements What do you often tell yourself or others that you re incapable of doing I know that I often say that I can t sing Is your statement really true Is it actually impossible for you to do that or is it just that you don t want to face up to the fact that effort discomfort and perhaps emotional pain might be involved Is my I can t sing true No Singing is certainly not something I m naturally gifted at but I can sing and I know that if I took singing lessons I could learn to improve my singing You always have the choice of saying can do about your dreams instead of can t do Using I can Today I m sure there s something in your life that you d like to change but that you feel you ve not yet made progress on Perhaps it s something that other people have had an influence over such as your sense of self worth or your material circumstances Perhaps it s something which you ve been secretly convinced you can t change Keep that part of your life in your mind for a moment Recognize that whatever the influences from other people and circumstances you do have 100 responsibility for your actions and thoughts You do have the power to choose your response And now realise that you can change this whatever it is Even if you ve tried and failed in the past even if you re afraid it will take a lot of hard work even if you don t know all the steps to fully changing that aspect of yourself or your life just yet You can change If you re willing to share your thoughts and your own experience of how I can empowers change please take a moment to add a comment to this post About the author Ali writes about personal growth and development on her blog

filed by Patterson s mother Chundra Smith But Smith turned down the offer because she wanted the county to be held publicly accountable said her lawyer Janet Izzo Smith didn t think deputies jail nurses or Sheriff Kevin Walsh ever acknowledged in pretrial depositions that if they d followed their own procedures Patterson would not have died Izzo said Chundra felt that there were already rules in place at the jail that should ve prevented her daughter s death Izzo said From Chundra s perspective it s not about the money offered by the county It s about them being publicly held accountable in a court of law for allowing her daughter to suffer and die The county and Smith reached an agreement last week in which the county admitted its employees negligence caused her daughter s death Izzo said County Attorney Gordon Cuffy said the county admitted liability but declined to comment further Walsh would not comment because the case is the subject of a lawsuit Patterson s death came 13 years after another inmate Lucinda Batts suffered a similar death at the Justice Center After her death from a ruptured ectopic pregnancy the state recommended changes in the jail s policy and training of employees One former deputy Diane Stech was involved in both cases In the 1996 death of Batts Stech told a nurse that she thought Batts was faking when she complained of pain according to jail records Two hours later Batts collapsed and later died at a local hospital In Patterson s case Stech was making rounds Nov 12 when she saw Patterson on the floor four times between 7 and 7 45 a m according to Stech s report The first time Patterson obeyed Stech s order to get up the report said Fifteen minutes later Patterson was on the floor again leaning on the toilet and splashing water in her face Stech wrote The deputy told her to stop and Patterson rolled onto the floor the report said At 7 30 a m Stech found Patterson on the floor again The deputy went into the cell saw the plastic cup in the toilet and removed it the report said The deputy looked at Patterson told her to get off the floor and it looked as if the inmate looked at me Stech wrote She then continued her tour Other inmates said they d heard Patterson moaning in pain through the night On her last visit to Patterson s cell Stech found her unresponsive the report said Stech called in other deputies and medical workers who tried to revive her the records show The deputies conduct was a violation of department policy that says they must remain alert for inmates who are too sick to help themselves the commission said The state faulted Stech for failing to recognize Patterson was in need of medical attention and recommended that the sheriff s office discipline Stech The fact that Patterson was three months pregnant was noted in her medical record at the jail The records give no indication that anyone examined her abdomen after her complaints of pain She was never given a pelvic exam or ultrasound either of which would ve shown she had an ectopic pregnancy in her fallopian tube and would ve probably indicated that it had ruptured according to an uninvolved physician interviewed about the case by The Post Standard Surgery could ve saved her life he said The commission said registered nurse Missy Clayton completely misinterpreted and minimized the significance of pain and vomiting in Patterson and recommended that the state Office of Professional Discipline investigate her conduct Clayton provided grossly and flagrantly negligent nursing care the commission said Stech and Clayton are among the witnesses whose videotaped statements will be played in the nonjury trial before state Supreme Court Justice Deborah Karalunas Izzo said she hopes to use those statements to show the pain Patterson suffered Shortly after the legislature approved the settlement offer in June the Onondaga County District Attorney s Office told Izzo that it had concluded its investigation into the death and found no criminal conduct she said Two days before her death Patterson was arrested for skipping her court date for one of her five arrests over five months She was accused of walking into a South Side convenience store drunk breaking a glass counter by slamming a beer bottle on it then smashing a glass door by punching it She then walked out with two stolen beers according to court records Two months earlier she was arrested for throwing a beer through her friend s living room window during a fight And she was charged with smashing another friend s cell phone as he tried to call 911 while they fought court records said Contact John O Brien at jobrien syracuse com or 315 470 2187 a trial's scheduled to begin tuesday to determine how much onondaga county must pay for the 2009 death of 21-year-old chuniece patterson at the justice center
