"",""body"":""There s more good news about pure maple syrup from the University of Rhode Island URI Researchers there have now identified 54 compounds in maple syrup from Canada double the amount previously reported and many with antioxidant activity and potential health benefits In laboratory studies they acted as anti cancer and anti inflammatory agents Initial studies also suggest that maple compounds may inhibit enzymes relevant in Type 2 diabetes management These new findings were presented on March 30th at the annual meeting of the American Chemical Society in Anaheim CA during a day long session exclusively examining the bioactive compounds found in natural sweeteners The session was organized and chaired by Dr Navindra Seeram assistant pharmacy professor at URI and a lead scientist on the maple syrup research team According to the URI research team maple syrup contains a cocktail of polyphenol compounds several with antioxidant properties and many with well documented health benefits We found a wide variety of polyphenols in maple syrup said Seeram It is a one stop shop for these beneficial compounds several of which are also found in berries tea red wine and flaxseed just to name a few Seeram continued Not all sweeteners are created equal When choosing a sweetener pure maple syrup may be a better choice because of the range of antioxidant compounds not found in other sweeteners Maple syrup may prove to be relevant in Type 2 diabetes management although the findings must be verified in clinical trials We discovered that the polyphenols in maple syrup inhibit enzymes that are involved in the conversion of carbohydrate to sugar said Seeram In fact in preliminary studies maple syrup had a greater enzyme inhibiting effect compared to several other healthy plant foods such as berries when tested on a dry weight basis By 2050 one in three people will be afflicted with Type 2 diabetes and more and more people are looking for healthier diets so finding a potential anti diabetic compound in maple syrup is interesting for the scientific community and the consumer said Seeram Five of the 54 antioxidants in maple syrup were identified for the first time in nature and are unique to the natural sweetener Among the five new compounds never before identified one polyphenol is of particular interest Given the common name of Quebecol in honor of the province of Quebec this compound is created during the process of boiling down maple sap into maple syrup We don t know yet whether the new compounds contribute to the healthy profile of maple syrup but we do know that the sheer quantity and variety of identified compounds with documented health benefits qualifies maple syrup as a champion food commented Seeram whose findings have recently been published in the Journal of Functional Foods Dr Seeram s work at URI is supported by a grant funded by The Federation of Quebec Maple Syrup Producers in conjunction with the Conseil pour le d\u00e9veloppement de l agriculture du Qu\u00e9bec CDAQ and Agriculture and Agri Food Canada AAFC on behalf of the Canadian Maple Syrup Industry Attendees at the American Chemical Society s annual meeting also heard promising results from other Canadian researchers who are studying the health benefits of maple syrup Part of our New Generation of Maple 2020 strategy is to work with talented scientists to discover and share more knowledge about maple syrup We are excited that this line of research receives interest from all over the world says Serge Beaulieu President of the Federation and member of the Canadian Maple Industry Advisory Committee Genevi\u00e8ve B\u00e9land Marketing Director for the Federation adds Maple is the most important food derived from the pure sap of trees and given its amazing potential for human health and great nutritional value it is a natural choice for a healthy lifestyle The Federation s members produce about 80 percent of the worldwide supply of

I could bake Reese s Peanut Butter Cups I know they are candy and I do venture into candy making every now and again but I don t really have candy making equipment and I tend to wing it with what I have on hand So I had to figure out a way to bake the Peanut Cups instead For me half the fun is figuring out how to make something and the more complicated the better And once the ideas start flowing it s hard to stop And then it came to me and I just knew it would work The sky opened up the sun came out all was right with the world and all I needed was the correct baking pan Well that was 5 months ago and just this week I finally found the right pan and then everything just fell right into place And please try to use Mascarpone Cheese in the brownies I know that many people substitute

Wednesday March 25 2009 at 12 01 00 AMLong before Americans realized you could put a few ounces of beer in a Solo cup chug those ounces put the cup on the edge of a table and flip it over our presidents were getting hammered Last night I found myself down the an Internet wormhole of researching the drunkenness of past presidents luckily enough I found 11 great drunk former American presidents And whenever I find 11 of something I go straight to my website So here are the 11 drunkest American presidents in chronological order A ton of credit for the anecdotes here goes to a book called The Health of the Presidents The 41 United States Presidents Through 1993 from a Physician s Point of View by John R Bumgarner Amazon link John Adams John Adams could really tear it up When he got into Harvard at age 15 he was regularly drinking beer for breakfast During a trip to Philadelphia in 1777 he wrote to his wife I would give three guineas for a barrel of your cider Not one drop of it to be had here for gold and wine is not to be had under 68 per gallon Rum is forty shillings a gallon I would give a guinea for a barrel of your beer A small beer here is wretchedly bad In short I am getting nothing that I can drink and I believe I shall be sick from this cause alone Now if you re like me yes you thought that perhaps the whole giving a guinea for your barrel of cider was him talking dirty to her But I m thinking no John Adams just wanted to get drunk In addition to his drunkenness he started smoking at age EIGHT and kept going until he died At age 90 Cause of death Old age Martin van Buren Martin van Buren used to drink so much that apparently he developed an Andre the Giant esque tolerance He could drink for days and not show any signs of being intoxicated so his friends gave him the nickname Blue Whiskey Van I m not sure what the blue is a reference to Is it the same blue top that Jamie Foxx references in Blame It On the Al Al Al Al Al Alcohol which is another blue related alcohol reference I don t get In the 1840 Presidential Election William Henry Harrison s campaign painted Van Buren as an alcoholic which contributed to Van Buren losing the election Franklin Pierce Franklin Pierce might have been America s MOST alcoholic president He drank hard for his entire adult life and kept going right on through his presidency When the Democratic party decided not to re nominate Pierce after his first term in office he told reporters There s nothing left but to get drunk Holla Franklin Pierce James Buchanan Buchanan basically centered his presidential life around drinking He would get angry when the White House would only be stocked with small bottles of champagne Every Sunday he d go to a distillery to pick up a 10 GALLON jug of whiskey He d drink cognac and up to two BOTTLES of other alcohol every night And by all reports he could really handle his liquor A reporter wrote There was no headache no faltering steps no flushed cheek All was as cool calm and cautious and watchful as in the beginning But while he was able to be a smooth drunk on the outside on the inside the alcohol was beating him up His immune system was so weakened that he got the gout and got dysentery twice Ulysses S Grant Grant has the biggest drinking reputation of any U S president Some reports said that during Civil War battles he d just sit there drinking all day long When he was on his death bed he passed out and a doctor was able to revive him and give him a couple of extra minutes of life by giving him brandy Chester A Arthur As president Arthur would drink wine and after dinner liqueurs pretty much nightly He gained about 40 pounds in office a lot of which was from constant drinking and having friends over to drink He would get drunk so often on Saturday nights that he d need a carriage to take him to church the next morning even though the church was literally less than a block away from the White House Grover Cleveland Cleveland had a huge beer belly because he used to drink beer daily Insert your own joke about how if he d just drank on non consecutive days he could ve lost weight here During one minor election early in his political career the all important 1870 race for district attorney in Erie County New York he and his opponent agreed to only drink four glasses of beer each day so they could stay clear headed for their race After a few days they decided that was too harsh and they were going to take the cap off William Howard Taft From what I can tell Taft was like the big fat guy in any group of friends who made things more fun He wasn t that huge of a drinker himself but he was definitely the frat guy in the 5XL Hawaiian shirt making sure all of his buddies were getting drunk He was the Bluto of presidents During his first year as president one of his aides wrote The President never takes anything to drink but is most profligate in making others imbibe Franklin D Roosevelt There are rumors that FDR was a big drinker He always just seemed to find his way around alcohol One good example A doctor put FDR on a low fat diet to try to help his hypertension and heart problems But FDR became underweight so the doctor told him he d have to put on weight again FDR s plan to gain it back Drinking mass quantities of egg nog John F Kennedy There s no actual proof that JFK was a drinker But I have an Irish friend named Molly who s one hell of a drinker and it s led me to believe that certain stereotypes exist because they re just true George W Bush Bush famously was arrested for driving under the influence in the 70s and according to the Liberal Media he spent his entire time at Yale drunk and much of his adult life as an on and off alcoholic Typical Liberal Media Honorable mention goes out to Betty Ford before she was an alcohol and drug rehab clinic she was a drunk ass First Lady And to Barack Obama who doesn t drink yet but is on such a mainstream publicity tour ESPN

and yes chances are I ll give you spuds There s also a fair chance me being me that they won t necessarily be the kind of spuds you re used to That I think it s safe to say is something you ve come to expect around here Take these potato cups individual shells made from thinly sliced potato and used to serve well anything Potato cups with smoked salmon To be honest I m not entirely sure how the idea for these potato cups emerged but emerge it did when faced with the prospect of making something for last Friday s cookalong with the Irish Foodies group The group invites any willing participants to make or bake something on a given evening each month and with a given theme Last Friday s theme was traditional Irish and while the spuds might be in a somewhat non traditional form they are undeniably an emblem of traditional Irish eating Fill them with smoked salmon or other suitably Irish fillings and you ve got yourself some individually sized tastes of Ireland Needless to remark these would be perfect fodder for the Paddy s Day Food Parade which is open to anyone who d care to concoct a dish with our national holiday in mind I d love to have your entries Potato Cups If there is such a thing as beginner s luck then that is what I had with my first batch of these I went from idea namely to line muffin tins with thinly sliced potato in order to create mini potato shells or cups to successful execution in fairly short order My second batch however stuck to the tin like crazy so while these are very easy to make there is a bit of devil in the detail Once you get the hang of these you ll find endless uses for them especially in the canap\u00e9s and starters department I filled mine with smoked salmon but any number of fillings are possible They can be made a few hours ahead of time if you like and I also tried freezing some which seem to work ok If you do freeze them defrost fully before use and give them a minute or two in a low oven to crisp up You ll need About 300g potato 1 large or 2 smallish potatoes use a dry floury variety 2 tsp vegetable oil or clarified butter a good pinch of salt You ll also need A mandoline or other implement to cut very fine potato slices and a 12 piece muffin tin I d also recommend some parchment paper to line the muffin tins The Steps Preheat your oven to 180C Scrub your potatoes very well and using a mandoline or similar slice the unpeeled potatoes very finely about 1mm thick Pat the potato slices dry on pieces of kitchen paper then toss them in the oil or clarified butter and salt If using parchment paper to line your muffin tins and I would recommend you do so cut out squares that will be large enough to sit into each individual tin otherwise use a non stick tin if you have one or at the very least grease your tins very well To prepare each cup press a square of parchment paper if using down into the muffin mould it won t sit perfectly but don t worry about that it ll sit better once you add the potatoes If you like you can make cuts in the parchment paper from each corner towards but not all the way through to the centre which should help it to sit a bit better Line the sides and base of each mould with potato slices such that each slice overlaps with at least half of the previously placed slice and so that you end up with a thickness of about 2 slices all round see also header notes above Bake until the potato cups are mostly a golden brown colour this took about 17 20 minutes for me but ovens vary so start checking after about 15 minutes as these can burn easily If you ve used parchment paper the cups can be removed straightaway and allowed to cool otherwise allow them to cool a little in the tin before easing them out gently using a knife They are amenable to any number of fillings The Variations The variations here really come down to what you use to fill the cups In this you are limited only by your imagination The Results Makes about 12 potato cups Potato Cups With Smoked Salmon And Cream Cheese You ll need 300g smoked salmon roughly chopped 150g cream cheese 3 tblsp chopped dill or to taste 3 tblsp chopped flat leaf parsley or to taste 1 tblsp capers drained lemon juice to taste freshly ground black pepper 12 potato cups as per recipe above The Steps Mix together the smoked salmon cream cheese dill parsley capers lemon juice and black pepper and adjust seasonings to taste Once you re happy with it use the mixture to fill the potato cups and serve The Variations You can skip the cream cheese if you like and just serve slices of smoked salmon in the potato cups sprinkled with lemon juice dill and parsley The Results 12 salmon filled potato cups individual potato cups: shells of thinly sliced potato which make an excellent vessel for lots of things. a mix of irish smoked salmon and cream cheese is just one of the possibilities. gluten-free, potato recipes, spud sundays, canapes, cream cheese, potatoes, smoked

Chesapeake Bay An estimated two million have been reported in the past week AP Source AP THE recent spate of mass animal deaths around the world is sparking conspiracy theories and doomsday predictions on the web From the US to New Zealand from Britain to Brazil bizarre cases of birds fish and crabs turning up dead en masse have been reported in the past two weeks and no one seems to know why Not that it s stopping residents of the internet from having a red hot go One example is from conspiracy theorists Joseph Watson and Alex Jones of prisonplanet com who blame it on the government According to the site authorities have routinely engaged in secret testing of biological and electromagnetic weapons that have detrimentally impacted both humans and animals many times in the past Others are blaming it on the New Madrid fault line in the southern US although how this affects birds flying in the sky we re not too sure And let s not even get started on the 2012 end of the world predictions Here at news com au we ve sifted through the evidence and present some saner possible explanations so you can decide for yourself if this is the end of days or just a freaky and gruesome coincidence Where a 30km stretch of the Arkansas River near Ozark about 200km northwest of Little Rock in the US What 100 000 drum fish washed up along a 32km stretch between the Ozark dam and a bridge in Franklin County Local authorities were alerted to the deaths last week and have since collected samples from the affected area How Keith Stephens from the US Game and Fish Commission said fish kills happen every year but the size of the latest one was unusual He suggested some sort of disease was to blame The fish kill only affected one species of fish he told CNN If it was from a pollutant it would have affected all of the fish not just drum fish Where Beebe a community of 5000 northeast of Little Rock What New Year s revellers in a small town noticed something other than fireworks falling from the sky as up to 5000 red winged blackbirds rained out of the darkness onto rooftops and footpaths and into fields One struck a woman walking her dog Another hit a police cruiser Birds were littering the streets the yards the driveways everywhere said Robby King a county wildlife officer It was hard to drive down the street in some places without running over them How They died from massive trauma said Game and Fish Commission spokesman Keith Stephens citing a report from the state poultry lab where the birds were examined Some speculated that a bout of bad weather was to blame Others said one confused bird could have led the group in a fatal plunge A few spooked schoolkids even guessed that the birds had committed mass suicide Beebe police captain Eddie Cullum said For all the doomsdayers that was definitely the end of the world Where The second unexplained US mass bird death happened in Louisiana where carcasses littered a stretch of highway near Baton Rouge What 500 birds were discovered dead in Pointe Coupee Parish How Olivia Watkins of the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries said We sent samples to a lab in Missouri and are waiting to get some results The birds a mixed flock of red winged blackbirds brown headed cowbirds grackles and starlings may have hit a power line or vehicles in the dark Louisiana s state wildlife veterinarian Jim LaCour said Two dozen of them had head neck beak or back injuries Dan Cristol a biology professor and co founder of the Institute for Integrative Bird Behavior Studies at the College of William Mary said the Louisiana birds may have been ill or startled from their roost They don t hit a power line for no reason he said Where A snow covered street in Falkoping Sweden What About 100 jackdaw birds were found lying dead on the road Swedish newspaper Aftonbladet reported How Local veterinarian Robert ter Horst speculated that the birds had fallen from the sky after being frightened by fireworks set off late on Tuesday However the cause of the jackdaws deaths was disputed after a truck driver claimed he was responsible Christer Olofosson a rescue services worker said the truck driver claimed he saw about 70 live birds on the road on Tuesday saying he ran over the lot of them and did not think it was a big deal He later realised it had attracted attention not only in the Swedish media but also abroad Police told the newspaper the majority of the jackdaws involved were not physically damaged which would contradict the truck driver s account of events Mystery Where Kentucky USWhat Kentucky wildlife officials say several hundred birds were found dead in the western part of the state The grackles red wing blackbirds robins and starlings were found last week How No reason has been discovered or given yet Where Little Bay and Waikawau Bay Coromandel Peninsula New ZealandWhat A carpet of hundreds of dead mostly eyeless snapper washed up on several Coromandel Peninsula beaches on Tuesday leaving people mystified Auckland resident James Hughes spotted the snapper floating close to shore after children rushed up to him and his friends holding some of the dead fish the New Zealand Herald reported We spoke to boaties coming in and they said there was a carpet of them floating in the water How A Department of Conservation official told Mr Hughes fish in the Coromandel area were starving because of weather conditions That s just completely untrue This was something deliberate and it s just wrong Mr Hughes saidWhere Thanet Kent EnglandWhat 40 000 dead velvet swimming crabs or devil crabs washed up on Thanet beaches Tony Childs Thanet Coast Project Manager told the Daily Mail We had a crash in numbers last year and we hadn t expected such a large population As happens with the circle of life in nature we expect the crabs to be naturally dispersed from our shores very quickly by our local seagulls How The cold weather in Britain has been blamed for the deaths We are hopeful the crab population will soon recover said Mr Childs The Daily Mail reported that the mass crab deaths made up 95 per cent of marine life affected by the cold snap Where Chesapeake Bay Maryland USWhat The Baltimore Sun reported an estimated two million spot fish died and washed up on the shore The dead fish are mostly adult spot with some juvenile croakers How State officials are investigating but suspect it was because of the near record cold Agency spokeswoman Dawn Stoltzfus said spot are susceptible to colder water she said and normally leave the upper bay by now They were perhaps late getting out Where Coast of Paranagu\u00e1 BrazilWhat At least 100 tonnes of sardine croaker and catfish have washed up on beaches over the past week Parana Online reported The President of the Federation of Fishermen s Colony of Parana Edmir Manoel Ferreira said at least 2800 fishermen depend on the daily seafood We are experiencing a very sad situation on the coast he said How Authorities took samples to verify the reason for the deaths Biologists have explained the deaths could be because of a possible increase in the concentration of algae that produce toxins This increase may lead to death in some species such as sardines Water samples taken from the bay showed elevated levels of two species of toxic algae Where Port Orange Florida USWhat Hundreds of dead fish floated around the waterways near homes WFTV reported surrounded by swarms of pelicans and buzzards Kayakers on the creek told WFTV they d seen fish around every bend and it appeared to be one of the most extensive kills they had seen How With AP AAP AFP Newscore the recent spate of mass animal deaths around the world is sparking conspiracy theories and doomsday predictions on the web. dead,

html"",""title"":""5 Creepy Ways Humans Are Plunging Into the Uncanny Valley 5 creepy ways humans are plunging into the uncanny valley 5 creepy ways humans are plunging into the uncanny valley"",""body"":""Way back in 1970 a Japanese roboticist named Masahiro Mori came up with the term uncanny valley the theory that as robots get more human like people will respond positively to them but only up to the point where they still definitely look like robots Once they cross that point or the uncanny valley real humans will be disgusted by their robot counterparts because they ll look almost like people but not quite And there is nothing we find more disturbing than that But what we re finding today is that it s not robots we have to worry about the uncanny valley is all around you Just consider 5 The Booming Realistic Sex Doll Industry While sex dolls have been around for decades and men s desire to have sex with a woman who won t talk back or ask for anything has been around forever it was an American who took them beyond a mere novelty and into the uncanny valley Artist Matt McMullen was trying to make art when he created his first lifelike miniature doll He posted pictures of the little lady on the Internet and surprisingly somebody asked if it was you know doable McMullen got an idea and the RealDoll was born an incredibly realistic looking sex doll complete with orifices real to the touch skin and hair and more recently moving parts and programmable personalities in some models So what s the problem Other than the fact that you can now get rich selling life sized masturbation aids and they cost up to 10 000 you have to ask what s the purpose of a RealDoll beyond what could be accomplished with the much simpler and cheaper Fleshlight Google it or you can just figure out what it is by the name Does making her look like this create a more human connection Because she what Fools you into thinking she s a real girl That s where it gets weird There are some men out there interacting with their dolls in ways that prove emotional bonds can be creepier than the kind used by dominatrixes For instance one guy recreated his dead lover in the form of a doll Another carries a picture of his doll in his wallet and cuddles with her on the weekends while watching movies just like he would with a real woman As the market grows the technology advances but only further into the valley Take the recent revealing of TrueCompanion s Roxxxy She comes with programmable personalities all of which are sexist stereotypes Then it was discovered that one of these personalities called Frigid Farrah will spurn and resist sexual advances In other words for the right amount of money a dangerous segment of the population can purchase pretend assault victims There are some people who are seriously worried about the long term implications of such lifelike sex toys Of course verbal resistance won t stop any RealDoll from being forced into the doll porn industry quietly spreading across the Internet right now Yeah this is a thing too No we won t give you the link Go talk to a real girl But what is chilling about these isn t the stiff rubber skin monsters they have now it s the ones they ll be manufacturing 20 years from now The ones your children will be bringing home that you won t be able to tell aren t real people until you look into their cold dead eyes 4 People Who Want to Be Anime Characters Animegao Kigurumi At some point Japanese anime went from a genre of cartoons to sexy cartoons to sexy cartoons men become obsessed with to uh this Kigurumi in general is about people dressing up as cartoon characters but here we re referring specifically to anime characters So it s like cosplayers but instead of using your own face and makeup to emulate your favorite anime character you wear a mask and a full body costume So what s the problem You wind up with this Again however most costumes out there are female Most players are male While we re not sure why there s a greater male to female ratio dressing as female characters we do know that it makes the following video even more disturbing In the video the masked kigurumi dances around with a bread stick not really doing anything more than a few spins What s the bread stick for We ve no idea Probably to subtly indicate that he s got a dong in there Other videos of which there are many feature similar actions including just lying around and a pillow fight that s lesbian or gay or neither But creepy no matter the sexual preference But we digress What makes the video and any other animegao kigurumi wrong to the eye is the stillness of the mask and the lack of facial reactions while the body moves The only other living things that do this are dead people Living dead people The oversized eyes don t help much either Look at the image below for more than 10 seconds and tell us you don t feel your will to live being sapped If you re thinking that sexual obsession with anime can t get any weirder than that hang on 3 People Who Want to be Anime Characters Part 2 Ulzzang Ulzzang or best face is a Korean subculture in which girls alter their looks digitally with a shitload of makeup and by any other means available to them to get that perfect anime look In other words a ulzzang girl is going to have behemoth circular eyes a teeny little nose and mouth flawless pale skin and an itty bitty body dressed up in perfectly coordinated outfits And once they get that creepily perfect look they upload pictures of themselves for online competitions for prestige and Internet fame So what s the problem You tell us Altering your face digitally to the point where you look like a doe eyed Disney alien is creepy enough but what s really messed up is when kids mess with their real world faces with real world eyelid glue and real world illegal contact lenses Because fuck eyes What do they do anyway So here s how ulzzang eyes work First you slab a shitload of makeup all over your face Then you jam some contacts designed to make your irises look huge into your eyes Never mind that the lenses will prevent oxygen from getting to your eyes which will lead to frequent infections and in a worst case scenario will actually poke a hole in your cornea and you ll literally go blind those big eyes of yours aren t freakish at all You can also thank Lady Gaga for this Once your sight is in danger it s on to the eyelid glue which is kind of a putty that you use to get rid of that pesky Asian monolid Here s an actual quote from a tutorial on applying the stuff Apply eyelid glue or tape to the eyes and using the pusher stick poke into the lid what shape you want until you get a crease So just to be clear pusher sticks are a real thing and what the sticks are pushing is the eye zone And the people who are pushing their eyes with sticks are doing so because they want to look more like cartoon characters and less like human beings See if you can chart the circular cultural path of this phenomenon It starts with artwork that creates crude caricatures of women huge innocent eyes girlish figures with giant boobs usually in schoolgirl costumes or some other fetish gear and then becomes so popular that real actual women want to alter their appearance to look not like some real Hollywood actress but like a drawing It s the fact that they re not human that makes them attractive That makes us rethink what we said before about how 20 years from now RealDolls will be so lifelike everyone will want one Instead real women will just start altering their appearance to look like RealDolls Artificial people don t need to make it out of the uncanny valley Real people will just meet them there what is the uncanny valley? something that's horrifying and happening right now.""}"	"culture_politics"	"0.380602"	"1.76969697"	"0.35"	"0.09"	"0.025"	"0"	"0.439147133"	"7.19E-04"	"0"	"0.091487669"	"0"	"0.223021522"	"0.06618705"	"1"	"1"	"9"	"0"	"13800"	"200"	"9"	"0.37"	"0.13856305"	"0"

favorite dessert and I will eat it in just about any form Rolled in a ball and dipped in chocolate Bring em on More about the challenge and the recipe after the break This was a fairly easy challenge albeit a little messy The cheesecake took quite a bit longer to bake than the recipe indicated but the result was absolutely worth it rich creamy and the perfect flavor The recipe calls for a 10 cake pan but since I don t have one I split the batter between a muffin style square tin given to me by my friend Amber and four mini springform pans I went without the water bath After thoroughly chilling the cheesecake I set forth to scoop them into balls This was definitely the messy part as my hands and just about everything else ended up covered in a layer of cheesecake I had my lollipop sticks ready to go and then encountered a problem I didn t have enough clearance in my freezer to stick the lollipop sticks in When I make buckeyes I usually use toothpicks which I never have a problem with but obviously the lollipop sticks are longer I had already crammed all of the rolled balls onto a baking sheet and didn t have space to insert the sticks sideways so I just did without them Hence my pops became truffles I chose to roll all of the cheesecake balls in bittersweet 60 chocolate and then drizzled with a combination of white and milk chocolates I dipped a corner of each square cheesecake into the dark chocolate as well Although these took a little bit of work and were a bit messy they are fabulous little treats I plan on saving the recipe and will make them again sometime in the future For now I have a gallon freezer bag full of my cheesecake truffles that will serve me well when I want a late night dessert snack Thank you to Elle of Feeding My Enthusiasms and Deborah

finely chopped you can use all one kind or half and half of dark milk or white Alternately you can use 1 pound of flavored coatings also known as summer coating confectionary coating or wafer chocolate candy supply stores carry colors as well as the three kinds of chocolate 2 tablespoons vegetable shortening Note White chocolate is harder to use this way but not impossible Assorted decorations such as chopped nuts colored jimmies crushed peppermints mini chocolate chips sanding sugars dragees Optional Directions Position oven rack in the middle of the oven and preheat to 325 degrees F Set some water to boil In a large bowl beat together the cream cheese sugar flour and salt until smooth If using a mixer mix on low speed Add the whole eggs and the egg yolks one at a time beating well but still at low speed after each addition Beat in the vanilla and cream Grease a 10 inch cake pan not a springform pan and pour the batter into the cake pan Place the pan in a larger roasting pan Fill the roasting pan with the boiling water until it reaches halfway up the sides of the cake pan Bake until the cheesecake is firm and slightly golden on top 35 to 45 minutes Remove the cheesecake from the water bath and cool to room temperature Cover the cheesecake with plastic wrap and refrigerate until very cold at least 3 hours or up to overnight When the cheesecake is cold and very firm scoop the cheesecake into 2 ounce balls and place on a parchment paper lined baking sheet Carefully insert a lollipop stick into each cheesecake ball Freeze the cheesecake pops uncovered until very hard at least 1 2 hours When the cheesecake pops are frozen and ready for dipping prepare the chocolate In the top of a double boiler set over simmering water or in a heatproof bowl set over a pot of simmering water heat half the chocolate and half the shortening stirring often until chocolate is melted and chocolate and shortening are combined Stir until completely smooth Do not heat the chocolate too much or your chocolate will lose it s shine after it has dried Save the rest of the chocolate and shortening for later dipping or use another type of chocolate for variety Alternately you can microwave the same amount of chocolate coating pieces on high at 30 second intervals stirring until smooth Quickly dip a frozen cheesecake pop in the melted chocolate swirling quickly to coat it completely Shake off any excess into the melted chocolate If you like you can now roll the pops quickly in optional decorations You can also drizzle them with a contrasting color of melted chocolate dark chocolate drizzled over milk chocolate or white chocolate over dark chocolate etc Place the pop on a clean parchment paper lined baking sheet to set Repeat with remaining pops

the cover on 9 11 inside job iraq war veteran and experienced demolitions expert blows the cover on 9\/11 inside job."",""body"":""Meet Torin Wolf He has a broad and varied background as a US Army Combat Nurse during Operation Iraqi Freedom building construction contractor certified structural welder certified asbestos and hazardous materials worker experienced demolitions expert teacher radio show host and well studied 9 11 truth activist Torin knows how to put a building up and bring the same building down in its own footprint Torin s free presentation Taking the Red Pill was hosted by Brave New Books on 1904 Guadalupe in Austin last Saturday June 23rd at 7 pm Torin is proud of his native Cherokee heritage and his mother is the Band Historian of the White River Band Cherokee from the central United States Since he received his GED at age 14 saying he is a smart guy is putting it lightly For over 12 years he worked as a hazardous materials contractor specializing in asbestos abatement and concrete construction sampling Add to his resume the fact that he designed and implemented well over 100 controlled demolitions He was not just helping at a lower level in the demolitions he was the guy responsible for calling the shots Afterwards he became a certified structural steel welder and worked in heavy and mega construction for over 5 years in locations around the world including several skyscrapers Ironically Torin signed his papers to join the army on September 11th 2000 He knew something was wrong with the official 9 11 story when his army handlers took his squad into a room just in time to watch the buildings collapse With his demolitions experience he immediately knew those towers could not have fallen like that without explosives He went on to serve with honor and distinction with the 21st Combat Support Hospital in Mosul Iraq during the first part of Operation Iraqi Freedom and earned the Bronze Star with V device for valor in combat While saving over 120 lives Torin earned the Combat Medical Badge by providing medical care to US allied enemy soldiers and civilians under combat conditions Torin s arms display Samoan life saving tattoos each line and symbol representing a group of lives saved The army would like you to think he wasn t in Iraq but unfortunately for them Torin appears in a recent documentary filmed there A true hero helping save lives in the middle east Torin can be seen in section 4 of a PBS documentary called Life and Death in the War Zone With Torins impressive list of qualifications his unwavering voice holds a power that shatters the lies of 9 11 sold to us by the government and mainstream media The official story we ve been told about 9 11 is absolutely physically impossible Those words are not just backed up with his qualifications because his presentation goes through the hard physics as well The presentation starts out with a serious warning that reminds us the state our country is in after the false flag attack and ensuing tyrannical hijacking of the government on that September morning A hijacking not by Bin Laden not by Al Qeada but by a group of tyrants that orchestrated and benefited from 9 11 Unless you want to be charged as a terrorist I suggest you leave the room now This is technically seditious material and you can be charged under section 802 of the Patriot Act just for being here This upsets a few people near the front row Everyone looks around to see if that will scare anyone off but luckily no one leaves and the presentation continues The bookstore is now filled with former American citizens now terrorists simply because they want to learn the truth of what happened on 9 11 If you think the patriot act only applies to foreigners or dehumanized muslims with brown skin you are very wrong Torin rubs the effect in even more We American citizens don t even have to be charged foreigners do Then tells us that the patriot act was written prior to 9 11 This is admitted Also admitted is the fact that the patriot act has been used to come after American citizens over eight hundred times The presentation moves on and goes through some of the just plain crazy theories of why the towers fell such as space beams holograms missiles orbs pterodactyls etc and easily debunks them Torin then adds There is evidence most of these are put out by the government as disinfo Then explains how the White House in violation of the law has bought 28 billion Billion with a B in fake news But the craziest most truly unhinged conspiracy theory for the towers falling on 9 11 Torin asks rhetorically Fire The official story cannot be recreated by any experiment NIST is the government agency involved in attempting to model what happened to the world trade center on 9 11 and they fail horribly NIST never models what happens after the collapse initiation and even what they do model before that is easily debunked NIST created 16 separate physics programs to simulate the WTC 1 2 collapses and only got 1 to collapse partially Torin adds When they did in the computer model they removed 40 of the structural support The cross trusses that the towers received a significant amount of their strength from had to be removed to have a collapse in the computer simulation Torin then mocks the official story There s no such thing as a pancake collapse but there is a progressive collapse A few slides are shown of progressive collapses throughout the world None of them are anything like what happened to the world trade center with its pulverized concrete 100 microns or smaller just seconds after the start of collapse and then its complete destruction Torin uses his expertise to explain to the audience how and why a real progressive collapse occurs and subsequently why the WTC was not a progressive collapse The biggest problem with the argument Torin explains Time Several slides are then presented that show the hard physics and observed time of WTC 2 falling Worst case scenario would require 0 5 seconds per floor for collapse The absolute minimum amount of time for a progressive collapse would be 43 seconds How long did it take for the building to fall in reality About 8 6 Seconds For the towers to fall at so close to free fall speed over 110 000 separate and independent structural support points had to fail simultaneously Pancake theory does NOT explain the failure of the cores Torin explains passionately obviously upset with the lies being told to the American people Nothing is holding the building up No resistance 110 000 structural failures at the same time Torin Nothing is holding the building up No resistance 110 000 structural failures at the same time Next we are shown an incredible bit of detective work on Torins part He shows a sequence of 12 different pictures of the collapse initiation of the North tower WTC 1 Torin explains that the antenna on the top of the world trade center is a perfect guide of measurement for height as there is a standard of changing the paint color of antennas once per fifty feet The part of the antenna on the roof of WTC 1 appears black then white alternated every fifty feet There is a guide wire in the bottom left of every picture that shows that the camera does not move Why is this picture so interesting It shows the antenna which is held up by the core columns fall before the rest of the building while the fire line on the 78th floor doesn t move Torin then goes through the hard physics of the scene we re looking at and explains how it directly contradicts the official story This building is not collapsing on the 78th floor The antenna falls 56 feet before the 78th floor falls Torin then gives his expert analysis on building 7 for about five minutes For those that are new to this information building 7 was the third building to collapse on 9 11 After a thirty second countdown was given by firefighters it collapsed perfectly into its own footprint at 5 20 in the afternoon It housed the IRS Department of Defense CIA Secret Service and the Security and Exchange Commission among many others While I can t cover all of the hard hitting information Torin brought up about building 7 the highlight was his analysis of the collapse which played over and over again on the screen behind him There is no doubt about it this is a controlled demolition profile then Torin directed everyone to view the kink which is characteristic of a controlled demolition Dangerously high levels of asbestos lead PCBs mercury radioactive materials and powdered concrete were in the air after the towers were demolished Much to the surprise of many audience members we learned from Torin that by far the most dangerous on the list was the pulverized concrete The pulverized concrete which was thick in the air around ground zero after the collapses of WTC 1 and 2 had a pH of 12 which is about the same as drain cleaner This pH level when breathed in and gets wet in your lungs will cause chemical burns Wet concrete can burn you Torin adds The asbestos is bad but that will kill you over 20 years the powdered concrete will kill much faster So its no surprise to learn that all of the 9 11 rescue and recovery dogs are dead Torins report goes on to explain how emissions from the WTC piles were recorded to be hundreds of times above the legal Permissible Exposure Limit as established by the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health for more than 2 weeks after 9 11 Sheer contempt of Christine Todd Whitman head of the EPA is expressed next by Torin Torin is rightly angry at her for saying the air was safe to breathe and that people should return to work even though they refused to release the data from their testing at that time to substantiate their declaration Torin uncovers that The EPA didnt begin monitoring for airborne asbestos levels until 8 00pm September 14 2001 a day and a half after they told everyone that it was safe to return Torin then cites the exact law that the EPA is violating and the number of regulatory duties that are violated as well Torin has caught the EPA in direct violation of a federal law punishable by up to 10 years in prison as well as a 250 000 fine for each violation Before the EPA did the tests independent tests were done in which the machines that do the air quality testing were so full of junk that they couldn t be read If that is the case Torin adds You must by law throw the sample out What was in the readable air samples Sampling of bulk materials and dust found generally low levels of asbestos Since Torin has worked with hazardous materials for over 12 years specializing in asbestos abatement he knows quite a bit about the industry There is no such thing as a low level of asbestos Bulk samples by Federal law either are 1 or are not 1 asbestos containing materials Bottom line the EPA failed to perform its duties in regards to 9 11 and actively encouraged people to enter an unsafe area containing hazardous materials As anyone working in the asbestos industry Torin wanted to land the contract to clean the asbestos in the World Trade Center We all wanted the contract you could clean a small section sell the contract and retire It was known in the industry as basically a goldmine of an asbestos abatement job a contract worth over 3 billion dollars Instead the owner of the World Trade Center complex Lucky Larry Silverstein actually made billions through insurance purchased before the towers destruction A critical slide in the presentation of Rudolph Giuliani is displayed next It should be noted that Giuliani agreed with Christine Todd Whitman that the air at ground zero was safe Giuliani was appointed U S attorney for the Southern District of New York in 1983 So he knew a thing or two about criminal investigation procedures Torin adds Knowing that one has to wonder why he sent more than 99 of the steel from the WTC to China and Korea in violation of proper chain of evidence Not only that it was sent overseas at a price undercutting a New Jersey company A company in New Jersey offered to pay 0 56 per ton but it was sent out of the country to be smelted before experts could analyze the steel for signs of explosives for 0 50 per ton Giuliani is clearly one of the perpetrators behind the crimes of 9 11 and he was confronted recently by a truth squad led by Luke Rudkowski They wanted to know why his story has changed five times about his activities on the morning of 9 11 So what does Torin think took down the WTC buildings Different forms of thermite such as thermate and one called super thermite If I was demolishing a building as high as the WTC I would use thermite It does what I want when I want Torin then gets into the science of thermite and what its actual chemical composition is The same chemical composition found in the previously molten metal microspheres found in the WTC dust discovered by professor Steven Jones The WTC microsphere samples showed the presence of aluminum Al magnesium Mg manganese Mn potassium K copper Cu and sulphur S Torins explanation continues The presence of sulphur in steel makes it brittle and lowers its melting point Sulphur is NOT used in structural steel because of this Powdered iron oxide Fe2O4 and aluminum in equal parts make a compound called thermite Add sulphur to thermite and you have a compound called thermate which is used in heavy demolition Torin then explains super thermite Add potassium permanganate KMnO4 and cupric sulphide CuSO4 to thermate and you have something called Super Thermite which is explosive and used in mega demolition such as WTC 1 2 For obviously criminal reasons NIST refuses to comment on the presence of Al Mg S K or Cu in the samples Torin finalizes the evidence of explosives with statements made from numerous firefighters and reporters at ground zero such as Capt Karin DeShore of the New York Fire Department Somewhere around the middle of the World Trade Center WTC 1 there was this orange and red flash Initially it was just one then this flash just kept popping all the way around the building and that building had started to explode These popping sounds and the explosions were getting bigger going both up and down and then all around the building Torin explains That is a controlled demolition profile she is describing Torin Save it why Because its a demolition angle So who isn t wanted for the crimes of 9 11 Gasps were heard from the audience as information relating to former paid CIA operative Tim Osman having no involvement in the crimes of 9 11 Tim Osman was Osama Bin Ladens CIA codename New evidence has been released in the past month showing how the federal government allowed planes personally chartered by none other than Osama himself to get friends and family out of the country after 9 11 A quote from Osamas FBI page shows that he is in fact not wanted for involvement in the crimes of that day Torin shows a quote from the FBI director at the time Robert Mueller saying that there is no legal proof to prove the identities of the suicidal hijackers Well sourced evidence is then shown from multiple mainstream news articles proving that many of the hijackers are still alive The official story does not add up The strongest part of Torins presentation is saved for the end the aftermath of 9 11 A bleak picture is shown of the results of the false flag attack An invasion of Afghanistan that was on Bush s desk two days before 9 11 over 655 000 admitted dead in the spreading war in the middle east cheap heroin out of Afghanistan that the former Taliban government destroyed soon to be full scale war in Iran several thousand dead troops and an oppressive police state at home being enforced by some of the returning aggravated felons that were doing the same in Iraq We are not deprogrammed after battle Torin explains when covering the mental aspects of war Torins insight as a combat nurse reveals that the actual amount of dead troops numbers around 15 000 17 000 not the 3 500 we have been told If you get shot in combat Bam Clock goes off If you die in transit to a hospital out of Iraq such as Ramstein in Germany you are not an official Iraq casualty The same holds true if the troops out of the country die 24 hours after they were hit in Iraq The official troop death number is just those that have died in action on the ground We are then shown that legally terrorist is a term that can be branded on virtually anyone If you have ever thought of spanking your child running a red light or made someone angry then by this definition you are a terrorist And if you are charged as a terrorist you will be tried in a military court With the power slanted against you in a military court the Hamdi v Rumsfeld case showed us that you do not even have to be released if found not guilty This is a lot to swallow when you realize that such persons are subject to indefinite imprisonment without charges legal representation or any of the other protections guaranteed by the Constitution Torins slide explains Then the definition of domestic terrorism is shown and we all learn that by this definition not wearing your seatbelt jaywalking speeding or spitting on the sidewalk is a terrorist act Fliers are shown next that originated out of the Department of Homeland Security and the Phoenix Arizona FBI office These are shown to policing agencies around the country Torin explains how nearly all of the groups encompass normal citizens who have done no wrong such as Torins favorite Lone Individuals If you don t fit in any group this is it After a brief question and answer Torin ends the presentation with a fitting quote from Thomas Jefferson Dissent is the highest form of patriotism A true patriot and truth activist Torin is dissenting to expose the lies and crimes of our government in order to get it back from the tyrannical criminal group sitting in power now and to return to the Constitution and Bill of Rights If you want to join Torin in this fight or ask him a question he can be heard every Saturday and Sunday on the We The People Radio Network from 12 to 2 pm central After his radio show you can join him in person with an Austin 9 11 truth squad getting the word out on the south steps of the state capital on Congress avenue every Saturday This article is only just a few highlights of Torins presentation so don t miss the one next month at Brave New Books Update 7 29 2007 Download Torins Full presentation in Power Point

to ship its first Google Glass units and just in time for them to arrive Google has now also posted the developer guidelines for its Glass Mirror API Access to the API itself it s worth noting is still in limited preview and only developers who have access to the Glass hardware will be able to work with the API Everybody else can also start working on apps based on the documentation but won t be able to test them This first version of the API which will allow developer to write what Google likes to call Glassware is still relatively limited and the most advanced feature developers get access to is probably the Glass wearer s location Because every application communicates with Glass through Google s servers the API provides developers with a set of RESTful services and is completely cloud based and none of the code will actually run on Glass itself At its core the API allows developers to send and receive information from Glass devices Using the API looks to be relatively straightforward though also a bit limited Users will subscribe to new app from the developer s website and Google has launched a set of icons developers can use on their sites for this too Google currently offers starter projects for Java and Python developers as well as client libraries for Go PHP NET Ruby and Dart Glassware The API will give developers the option to communicate with users through timeline cards which can include text rich HTML images and video These timeline cards are not unlike Google Now cards on Android and can be bundled into packages and users can navigate between them or they can come as stand alone cards The API also provides developers with the ability to add menu items to their apps These Google says can be system commands like read aloud but developers can also write custom commands for their specific apps that users can bring up through the menu system or through voice commands As for the user interface Google gives developers the option to use their own custom HTML but the Glass team also provides developers with a base CSS file As Google notes crafting your own template gives you the power to control how your content is rendered but with that power comes responsibility Because of this Google strongly encourages developers to use its own template Photos and videos H 264 and H 264 baseline should have a 16 9 aspect ratio and should have a resolution of about 640x360px chances are that s also the maximum resolution of the Glass display Audio can be delivered in the AAC and MP3 formats Best Practices Given that Glass is a new concept Google also posted some general guidelines for how apps should interact with Glass though it s not clear if the company plans to enforce any of these directly Developers Google says should make sure they apps are designed with glass in mind and should always test their apps on Glass before releasing them The glass experience should also never get in the user s way and apps shouldn t annoy users with frequent and loud notifications Apps should also focus on real time notifications and apps should react to a user s action as soon as possible Most importantly given that Glass is meant to be worn all day developers should not surprise users with unexpected functionality Overall many developers will surely feel as if Google is limiting how much they can do with Glass but it s worth remembering that this is only a first release and chances are that Google will make more features available to developers in the future Here are a few of the videos Google posted today that explain some of the Mirror API s features in more detail September 7 1998 NASDAQ GOOG Google provides search and advertising services which together aim to organize and monetize the world s

Need to Know about the Best Cardio Machines Your body is always ultimately going to be the best cardio machine Whether a cardiovascular exercise is effective or not has less to do with the machine than you would think Cardio exercise is not fun for most people especially avid weight trainers If you have not visited the best cardio exercise page you probably should check it out Knowledge is power and it could save you hundreds of hours of sweating in the gym The Main Purpose of any Cardio Machine is to Raise your Heart Rate With the best cardio exercises you are not twiddling your thumbs you are moving the large muscles in your body which require a lot of oxygen which is circulated in your blood When you get your blood pumping your heart rate rises to pump the blood to your working muscles If you are out of shape and look to get back into it your extremities may fatigue before your heart does If you have the knowledge about which cardio machines are best for your goals you can maximize your cardiovascular exercise How do you Find which Cardio Machine is Best for You The Best Cardio Machines for Your Best Friend May Not be Best for You You already know that the most important aspect of successful cardiovascular exercise is to raise your heart rate Even though you can raise your heart rate on any cardio machine there is a cardio machine which is best for you The Best Cardio Machine for You Depends on a Few Factors Whether you Enjoy it or NotIt may seem amateurish to have such an obvious solution but it is very important to enjoy the exercise If you enjoy or hate less a certain cardio machine it is best for you You get absolutely no benefit if you don t use the best cardio machines Whether the Cardio Machine Exacerbates any Physical ProblemsYou have heard a million times everything in moderation It holds true when using the best cardio machines If you perform the same motion over and over again it will lead to muscle imbalances which lead to static and dynamic posture problems If you sit all day at work in front of a desk the stationary bike is not the best choice for a cardio machine If you have extremely bad knee problems the stair master is most likely going to do harm than good Whether the Cardio Machine is Consistent with Your GoalsIf you look to burn fat improve and maintain your cardiovascular fitness all of the best cardio machines will help you If your goals are performance related you predominantly use a cardio machines which most closely relates to your given activity For example if you are a marathon runner the majority of your cardio exercise should be running This does not mean that you shouldn t use the stationary bike every so often Whether the Machine is Conductive for a Productive WorkoutEven though you can get the same cardiovascular benefit from any cardio machine some are just more difficult Some cardio machines are more difficult than others simply because they are more difficult to be lazy on Why are There So many Different Types of Cardio Machines Cardio Machines were first Developed for Training Purposes not Fat Burning Devices Cardio machine used to be predominantly used for training Treadmills were used by people who couldn t get outside to run Rowing machines were used by people who wanted to train their rowing ability without the inconvenience of getting to the river People started to become overweight at an alarming rate and the fitness revolution happened in the 1980s Cardio machines were designed to simulate daily physical activities which could be done in place on a machine Later on in the 1990s elliptical machines were designed specifically for non impact exercise Here is an Overview of Cardio Machines you will Find in a Gym in no particular order Treadmills Treadmills are for for the most basic impact exercise walking jogging and running Every quality treadmill has the ability to change the speed and incline level of hill to about 10 15 incline Treadmills usually have safety features such as an auto stop switch and side handles to make sure you don t kill yourself Another feature of the best treadmills is a remote heart rate monitor It is not convenient to put your hands on the hand heart rate monitors when you running if you are serious about your exercise intensity The best treadmills allow you to put a strap around your sternum which will send your heart rate to the treadmill by remote Exercise Tip If you do not like running walking on the treadmill can be just as effective for burning calories fat and cardiovascular effect The key is to set the treadmill at a significant incline Working against gravity will increase difficulty and caloric expenditure Do not pull on the handles when you have an incline If you grab the handles it completely defeats the purpose of the incline The calories burned meter on the machine will not be accurate also If you have to hold on the for dear life you should probably slow down the machine Recumbent Stationary Bikes Recumbent bikes are the lazy person s favorite cardio machine If you make the trek to your local gym you will definitely see a few people read a magazine while they watch TV and talk on their cell phone on a recumbent bike This does not have to be the case Like any of the best cardio machines you can elevate your heart rate significantly on the recumbent bike but you have to have some kind of motivation Exercise Tips If you want to get the best cardio workout on a recumbent bike use one of the hill profiles These are interval programs which raise the resistance for intervals At the top of some hills you will want to quit because your legs burn so bad but just as you are ready to quit the interval will be over and you will be coasting again Make sure you set up the distance to the pedals properly Your legs should come to almost full extension but not locked If the pedals are too close you will most likely burn out your leg muscles more than increase your heart rate Recumbent Bike Reviews Elliptical Trainers Elliptical machines are famous for non impact exercise Non impact exercise means there is minimal compressive forces on your bones and joints There are 2 main varieties of elliptical machines One variety has handles which allow upper and lower body concurrent push pull movement The intensity is increased by adding resistance The other variety does not have handles and usually allows the incline level of the foot rests to be adjusted as well as resistance Exercise Tips Do not make the elliptical machine your only source of cardio If you perform only non impact exercise your bone mass and strength could suffer in the long term To get the best workout on an elliptical machine with handles set the resistance high so you have to use your arms as well as your legs Elliptical Trainer Reviews Stairmasters Stairmaster is actually a brand of stair stepper machines which predominantly known as Stairmasters now The motion of a Stairmaster is similar to climbing up steps but your body weight is actually pushing the steps down If the difficulty of the Stairmaster is increased the steps will fall faster which will cause you to step faster On a Stairmaster your are working directly against gravity and your body weight Any time a cardio exercise has a vertical component it will be more difficult than horizontal only activities Stairmasters have been known to be hard on the knees If you have any major muscle imbalances and posture problems the Stairmaster is probably not your best cardio machine Exercise Tips Like most of the best cardio machines it is better for you to not hold onto the handles for dear life The handles are for balance If you need to support your body weight with the Stairmaster you should lower the intensity level To get the most effective workout on a Stairmaster use an interval program Which most cardio exercises on machines the interval programs will allow you to burn the most calories a shorter amount of time Interval programs are great because they work you aerobic and anaerobic systems together which has a significant effect on your metabolism Stepmills Stepmills or Stairmills are like the escalators from hell It is just like you are stepping up your local stadium steps except they are never ending Stepmills are not for the beginner Even at very low settings Stepmills get your heart rate up very quickly When you increase the difficulty level the escalator goes faster Something else to take note of is the steps are pretty narrow If you have feet over size 12 it may be awkward to exercise on the Stepmill which is definitely one of the best cardio machines to get your heart rate up and keep it up Exercise Tips Do not support your entire body weight with the handles You should hold them for safety reasons but they are not to support your body weight which takes away from the exercise s effects You can also step up sideways both ways on Stepmills This is a great way to help functionally strengthen your legs stabilization mechanism inner and outer thighs Do not try this if you have any ligament problems in your knees Adaptive Motion Trainers At the time of this writing the only models of these types of trainers in existence are the Precor Adaptive Motion Trainer and the Technogym Vario Adaptive motion trainers represent the evolution of cardio machines and a huge step up from elliptical and arc trainers The reason being is freedom of movement As the name suggests adaptive motion trainers adapt the motion of the exercise to your movements Rather than traveling in a same motion such as an ellipse you are free to move whichever way you like While there is some limitation you can perform movements ranging from stepping up and down short stride rowing long strike running and elliptical like motions All this freedom comes with a price as these types of the best cardio machines are very expensive and the price is unlikely to come down until there is more competition Exercise Tip Get the most out of the adaptive motion trainer by varying the types of strides you take Since you can perform different types of motions and you have control over how long your perform them for use the timers on the machines programs to avoid performing too much of a single motion and have a balanced workout Versa Climbers The Versa climber is one of the best cardio machines you have never heard of If you do have a Versa climber in your local gym it is one of the least popular cardio machines and is probably collecting dust The Versa climber is such a good cardio machine because you are climbing vertically which is directly against gravity You also use your upper and lower body equally which increases heart rate quickly To increase the difficulty of the versa climber you can add more resistance When you add more resistance you can push and pull which will not only work your muscles but give you a tremendous cardio workout Exercise Tip The versa climber is a tremendous cardio machine to use for interval training At a decent intensity level the Versa Climber can be tough even for 5 minutes It is possibly the best cardio workout to alternate a few minutes on the Versa climber with a couple minutes on a stationary bike or any other cardio machine you can make a quick transition to Tread Climbers The treadclimber is one of the newer cardio machines to hit the market Upon its release there was immediate claims of it being the best cardio machines but their popularity never really took off likely because the treadclimber is an awkward combination of a Stairmaster and treadmill This cardio machine has independent treadmills which rise and lower every time your foot strikes There is no running on the tread climber only walking which makes it a comfortable way to burn calories if you are significantly overweight Exercise Tips The up and down motion of each independent treadmill is not controlled by the machine but rather the strikes of your foot Unless you want a wild unproductive cardio workout make sure you plant each foot evenly and don t stomp Like most of the best cardio machines you should not support the majority of your body weight on the handles Because of the awkwardness make sure you hold to the handles when you first try the tread climber Incline Trainers Incline trainers are simply treadmills with the ability to increase the incline past the usual 15 all the way to 30 40 Having a higher maximum incline allows you to burn the same amount of calories walking on a high incline than jogging or running on a lower incline This makes incline trainers the best cardio machines for people who don t like running or jogging While the amount of calories burned is always going to depend on the effort you put in many people are uncomfortable running which makes incline trainers superior to standard treadmills as they will allow you to burn more calories walking The incline trainers also allow more advanced exercisers the ability to exercise at higher intensities and inclines which is important for people who train for hiking and other high incline high intensity events Exercise Tip As with regular treadmills the handlebars are mainly present as a safety precaution and to aid balance Holding on and leaning much of your body weight with the handles defeats the purpose of increasing the intensity of the machine If you find yourself holding on the handles for dear life lower the incline or speed Stationary Bikes There are probably a million different models of stationary bikes Stationary bikes are upright with no back rest Every gym in the world has a few stationary bikes The way to increase the intensity of a stationary bike is to increase the resistance of the pedals Most stationary bikes have many different programs In some programs increase the resistance on preset intervals and some depend on your heart rate The programs which use your heart rate increase the resistance to keep you at your target heart rate The machine usually determines your target heart rate for you from the information which you enter in before you start the program Exercise Tip Make sure you sit upright and do not slouch when using the stationary bike If you work a job or live a lifestyle where you sit for many hours during the day you should probably not use the stationary bike and use a standing machine Your hip flexors are most likely tight which would cause posture problems if you overdo work on the stationary bike The best cardio machines can hurt you as well as help you Fan Bikes The Schwinn Airdyne exercise bike was the first patented fan exercise bike to provide a full total body workout They were brought on the market in the 1980s and have endured to this day Fan bikes or dual action bikes made by other brands are often referred to as Airdyne bikes after the Schwinn model that has been around the longest Airdyne bikes are an upright exercise bicycle which incorporates arms in which the exerciser has to push and pull to aid in moving the machine at higher resistances The giant fan which is powered by your feet pedaling and arms pushing and pulling blows at the exerciser which can be great during difficult sweaty workouts Read Full Airdyne Bike Review Exercise Tip Since Airdyne bikes are designed with concurrent upper and lower body in mind performing one at a time is not the best way to use them Set the resistance level high enough to where you cannot perform the exercise comfortably without using your arms Now you will get the most out of the Airdyne bike as you are using your arms as well as your legs Rowing Machines The rowing machine is the most underrated cardio machine in the gym Most people do not understand the correct way to use rowing machines Rowing machines are obviously the best cardio machines for simulating rowing but they are great for cardio as well if you know how to use them Rowing machines are not meant to be a resistance exercise When people improperly use them they are usually pull very hard with their arms and have bad form The difference between rowing machines and all other cardio machines is you completely control how intense your session will be The faster you go the more intense your cardio workout will be This is why rowing machines are not the most popular cardio machine you must have motivation to get the full benefit from rowing machines Exercise Tips To get full cardio benefit of the rowing machine you should use one of the programs which is built on the little screen These programs will show you intervals which allow you to pace yourself so you don t get burned out too quickly Arc Trainers The arc trainer is another non impact cardio machine They are the newest type of cardio machine in your local gym and are probably most popular You step on two platforms and basically swing your legs back and forth in a similar fashion to the gazelle freestyle which has been a top selling home workout machine for years The adjustable resistance as well as the speed which you choose to swing your legs back and forth in the scissor like motion adjusts the intensity of your cardio workout Exercise Tips Non impact machines are the best cardio machines for people with chronic joint problems The arc trainer can get your heart rate up effectively without putting too much stress on your legs Don t let the non impact style cardio machine sabotage your results though Make sure you work hard and keep your heart rate up higher than your target zone If you are free of joint problems make sure you use forms of impact exercise such as jogging to keep your bones strong and your bone mass at optimal levels Hand Ergometers Hand ergometers or hand bikes are not anybody s favorite cardio machines When you are forced to use a hand ergometer it usually means you either have a broken leg sprained ankle surgically repaired knee or are bound to a wheel chair Hand ergometers can actually get your heart rate up faster than leg cardio machines because your arms are closer to your heart than your legs Hand ergometers have been used often in research about heart rate response among other things Exercise Tip Think happy thoughts The hand bike is not very fun and can be quite boring Very few people choose to use the hand bike as a form of cardio Perhaps some of the best exercise music will help you get through your rehab Looking for the Best Value Cardio Machine and Best Possible Workout Top 5 Cardio Machines If you do not have or want a gym membership a cardio machine at your home is a good idea To make sure it doesn t turn out to be the most expensive coat rack you ve ever owned make sure you have did thorough research Amazon comYou can find new and used mostly refurbished cardio machines on

Noel Columbia University Photo Credit 1One of the few things that makes Monday mornings even more dreadful than they already are is when one has to rummage in the laundry hamper dig through the drawers and tear through the closet in order to piece together a superb outfit and make it on time to work or school As ideal as spending the previous night picking out and coordinating the perfect outfit sounds in our minds in reality most of us are either too busy or too tired to bother Yet most of us also refuse to or just can t opt for sloppy less snappy ensembles Photo Credits 1 2 3In light of the time crunch college students face a uniform might not be a bad thing No I don t mean a plaid skirt and collared top \u00e0 la Catholic schoolgirl but a general schema for how you dress every day Contrary to popular myth a uniform is not a sign of a lack of individuality or a lack of creativity After all Jacqueline Kennedy was known for her pillbox hats and tailored suits in the sixties Alexander Wang loves his cotton t shirts and dapper sneakers and Karl Lagerfeld is never without a sharp tie and a pair of black sunglasses Having a personal uniform saves time and relieves stress in the mornings and gives you a signature look that others will remember you by Tips for Creating Maintaining a Personal UniformCreating a personal uniform for yourself appears to be a daunting task at first but can save you time and gain you a lot of attention in the long run Start with these simple steps and work your way into slightly less stressful mornings and dashing style Take photos Invest in a Polaroid camera or just use the self timer on your digital camera to take photographs of your outfits in order to figure out what you like and don t like Figure out what your signature accessories are and stick with them Do you always wear a strand of pearls around your neck Do you have thirty pairs of tights and stockings that you always wear with skirts or dresses Make sure you have enough varieties of your signature piece to last you all week whether it s a collection of patent leather heels or giant cocktail rings Even if you decide to mix and match the rest of your outfit a signature item will reduce the time spent accessorizing and completing your outfit in the morning Make guidelines for each piece while still leaving a lot of flexibility into your uniform You can easily do this by naming or categorizing each component of your uniform for example a structured blazer an A line dress or straight jeans A structured blazer ensures that you re picking something work appropriate but is open to interpretation think about it what does structured exactly mean at the same time Choose your uniform components based on what looks best on you That includes only wearing trends that look good on you You re much less likely to change your entire style or wardrobe if you are already wearing what looks best on you Organize your closet and drawers based on pieces instead of colors or seasons That way even if you re half awake in the morning you can choose an outfit efficiently without frantically searching for a peacoat Think investment not disposable Disposable fast fashion can be fun but investing in high quality unique or classic pieces will eventually save you time and money That doesn t mean you need to sell your kidney in order to buy the latest Alexander McQueen collection but it does mean you should buy pieces that you know will last you a long time and that you will wear for a long time whether it s a pencil skirt from H M or a vintage Chanel 2 55 purse Having a personal uniform doesn t have to be dry at all It s time efficient consistently interesting and conceptually unique so you can spend less time rummaging through your closet and more time turning heads as you stride to work or school Looking for more inspiration Check out Sheena Matheiken on The Uniform Project where she wears the same dress every day for an entire year raising

pneumatic prosthetic does mind-control on the cheap"",""body"":""Ryerson students invent breakthrough brain controlled prosthetic arm March 29 2011Ryerson biomedical engineering students Michal Prywata and Thiago Caires prosthetic arm is controlled by brain signals which is a first in medical prosthetics Two Ryerson University undergraduate biomedical engineering students are changing the world of medical prosthetics with a newly developed prosthetic arm that is controlled by brain signals The Artificial Muscle Operated AMO Arm not only enables amputees more range of movement as compared to other prosthetic arms but it allows amputees to avoid invasive surgeries and could potentially save hundreds of thousands of dollars The AMO Arm is controlled by the user s brain signals and is powered by artificial muscles simple pneumatic pumps and valves to create movements In contrast traditional prosthetic limbs which typically offer more limited movements rely on intricate and expensive electrical and mechanical components Developed by third year student Thiago Caires and second year student Michal Prywata the AMO Arm is controlled by the brain and uses compressed air as the main source of power The digital device makes use of signals in the brain that continue to fire even after a limb is amputated Users wear a head set that senses a signal for example the thought up and sends it wirelessly to a miniature computer in the arm The computer then compares the signal to others in a database The resulting information is sent to the pneumatic system which in turn activates the arm to create the correct movement Simulating the expansion and contraction of real muscles the system makes use of compressed air from a small refillable tank in the user s pocket The artificial muscle system created by Caires and Prywata is a first in the field of prosthetics and they continue to work on perfecting their system For example the pair is working on a design to fit the tank into the arm itself Since the device does not include microelectronics and motors it costs one quarter of other functional prosthetic arms which can run users more than 80 000 depending on the complexity of the prosthesis Other prosthetic arms with a similar degree of control require patients to undergo a complex muscle re innervation surgery a complicated procedure that costs about 300 000 and is not available in Canada and not covered by the provincial health plan As the AMO Arm is non invasive the period of adjustment for new users is drastically decreased While traditional prosthetics may require weeks of learning and training basic function with the AMO Arm can be mastered in mere minutes In just ten minutes of practising a person can pick up the mind control aspect of the technology says Prywata Moreover he says the AMO Arm will not only benefit amputees but could also be used as an assistive device on wheelchairs enabling users to reach things with greater ease The technology could also be used by the military to facilitate remote operations and in situations requiring robotics The AMO Arm can currently move up down left right as well as open and close The initial concept for the AMO Arm was developed shortly after Caires and Prywata met at a Ryerson Engineering open house in fall 2009 Each showcased different projects and were impressed with the other s work It took a year to develop the software program for the AMO Arm while the actual prototype was created during a marathon 72 hour design session Caires and Prywata s invention went on to win first prize at the 2011 Ryerson Engineering Competition and took home first place awards for innovative design and social awareness at the Ontario Engineering Competition in February The wins at the provincial level qualified Caires and Prywata for the Canadian Engineering Competition which was held earlier this month in Montreal There the AMO Arm placed second in the innovative design category Caires and Prywata are working to move each finger on the AMO Arm individually Independent finger movements require many more sensors Caires says For example while not impossible it s still quite difficult to grab a key and unlock a door In the future the pair would also like the AMO Arm to sense different materials e g an egg versus a full bottle of water and adjust the force used proportionately They have already developed an innovative concept for capacitive sensing which detects different materials prior to contact The students also have plans to develop an adaptive system one that will progressively learn from a user s movements and carry them out seamlessly Although they are still students Prywata and Caires are moving ahead on the commercialization of their innovations They have formed their own company Bionik Laboratories Inc www bioniklabs com and are currently seeking three patents for the AMO Arm and their other technologies Their recent acceptance into Ryerson s home of innovation and commercialization the Digital Media Zone DMZ will help them in achieving these goals Gaining residency in the DMZ www ryerson ca dmz was a key move for their business which while still quite recent has already yielded positive results We were really impressed with the DMZ space initially but didn t know about all the resources at our disposal and the exposure it would afford us until we got here The first day we arrived we were meeting people including CEOs and within a week we were shooting a piece for the Discovery Channel says Prywata Through their time at the DMZ Bionik is hoping to build their business and create partnerships and connections with organizations such as the Ministry of Research and Innovation MRI and MaRS which fund medical research and development Our backgrounds are not business so we have been learning quickly from the people around us at the DMZ  we're no strangers to amputees moving stuff with their minds --

taxpayers have given 50 billion to rescue General Motors but the company says it should not have to pay a penny to people harmed by known defects in its vehicles APRIL 2009 Engine fires prompts GM recall of nearly 1 5 million cars Despite the billions the company is in collapse and filed for bankruptcy Jun 1 to re work debts and restructure its operations It will dump the Hummer and Saturn models lay off 21 000 workers shutter 3 000 dealerships and start anew as a largely U S owned company with a green edge As it negotiates bankruptcy in a New York court the company is arguing that it should be absolved from paying out money to people who are hurt as a result of known problems in its cars already on the road Consumer groups are fighting against the plan and a similar deal already granted to Chrysler If any defect in a GM car causes an accident or injures someone or kills the occupants there would be no recourse no opportunity for compensation or to make a claim in a lawsuit It would affect every single driver of a GM vehicle Joanne Doroshow executive director of the Center for Justice and Democracy told IPS In restoring GM to health don t compromise the health and safety of consumers Clarence Ditlow executive director of the Center for Auto Safety told IPS The U S now owns 72 5 percent of GM and the United Auto Workers health care trust owns 17 5 percent The union gained a seat on GM s board and it agreed not to strike through 2015 GM has one of the very worst safety records among car makers With 30 million vehicles on the road the company is sued by the hundreds each year for known defects that result in people being killed burned and disabled according to Doroshow s group Victims file the lawsuits for help with medical bills which can be extremely expensive in the U S private health care system Each year between 500 and 1 000 people are harmed or killed in GM and Chrysler vehicles according to the Center for Auto Safety Chrysler has 10 million vehicles on the road Robert Doss of Arizona filed a lawsuit on behalf of his eight year old son Shaun Shaun became a paraplegic after the seatbelt in his father s Chrysler Dodge Durango failed during an accident Their lawsuit will not go forward now Doss told reporters Wednesday while visiting Congress Jeremy Warriner of Indiana whose legs were burned beyond saving three years ago when brake fluid spilled and ignited during an accident in his Jeep Wrangler said the personal injury lawsuit he filed against Chrysler also is defunct since the bankruptcy deal Chrysler used U S bankruptcy law to sweep the people who have been injured by Chrysler products under the rug and walk away as if it never happened Warriner said The consumer groups have filed an appeal to the bankruptcy court to reverse its decision about Chrysler GM filed for bankruptcy after years of bad management and its reputation for poor quality vehicles caught up with it during the recession Some of its vehicles have been plagued repeatedly by egregious safety problems like roofs that collapse during rollover accidents gas tanks that ignite upon impact and weak seats that give way The government has investigated most of the defects They conclude that there aren t enough crashes injuries and fatalities to warrant a recall that could cost hundreds of thousands to the manufacturers Ditlow said Instead the car companies are expected to pay out money to victims who sue One such lawsuit was settled in 1995 against General Motors and Chevrolet at that time The companies built pick up trucks in the 1970s and 1980s in which the gas tanks were outside of the frame and vulnerable to impacts More than 500 of the trucks had exploded and 183 people died Trucks with a similar design are still on the road Ditlow said GM spent 2 7 billion dollars on product liability losses in 2007 more than any other car company which relates to its size and its poor safety record Ditlow said You don t pay that out unless you have serious defects in your cars Ditlow said If the judge in the GM bankruptcy takes away people s right to sue the company the consumer groups hope Congress will step in and create a fund for victims They could clearly do this and it s a reasonable thing to do Doroshow said Long time consumer advocate Joan Claybrook testified to Congress recently and urged lawmakers after decades of asking to finally step up safety requirements in vehicles to prevent harm The unfinished motor vehicle safety agenda is long and deep Claybrook the former president of Public Citizen told the House Judiciary Committee on May 21 Motor vehicle crashes kill over 40 000 U S citizens every year injure another 2 5 million and are the leading cause of death for all persons in the United States ages four to 34 she said An injury due to motor vehicle accident occurs every 10 seconds and a motor vehicle fatality occurs every 12 minutes Claybrook said These manufacturers for the last 40 years have bobbed and weaved to oppose any serious improvements in motor vehicle safety fuel economy and emissions Claybrook said 2009 Inter Press Service "",""url"":""commondreams org headline 2009 06 06

now a bp police state as law enforcement conspires with bp to intimidate journalists"",""body"":""NaturalNews Normally I would open this article by explaining this is the story the mainstream media won t dare report Except in this case they are reporting it It s right on CNN on the Anderson Cooper 360 report What happened is that Lance Rosenfield a photographer working for ProPublica http www propublica org was standing on a public road taking photos of a BP refinery in full public view After taking his photos he was tailed by local law enforcement officials to a gas station where they demanded to look at the photos he had just taken A private BP security goon then showed up at the scene and an official from the Department of Homeland Security soon arrived and began to intimidate Lance With his wits about him and some basic knowledge of the Bill of Rights Lance at first refused to show his photographs to local law enforcement They threatened to detain him probably under the Patriot Act if he didn t so he gave in and let them see the photos Later when private BP security personnel asked for Lance s personal information he refused to give it to them So get this the police turned over his private information to the BP security goon As Lance explained on CNN The BP the BP security guard showed up at that point and asked me for my personal information and I declined because he s a corporate security guard And he turned to the police officer who then turned over all my personal information And I protested I said I didn t understand under what legal what legal grounds he was able to give him my personal information The reporter O Brien then asks him So when you asked him what did he say Lance replies He didn t give an answer He said well we can we re going to do it anyway whether you like it or not And we can call our Homeland Security officer Tom Robison to come down here and explain it But you know this is what I m going to do anyway And he didn t give me an answer And then he did call Tom Robison this Homeland Security officer came Tom Robison it seemed like his only point of being there was to intimidate me And of course Lance Rosenfield is right They are there to intimidate people Local law enforcement and the Department of Homeland Security are now all working for British Petroleum This is exactly what I warned about by the way in a recent article that was widely read across the net entitled First Amendment suspended in the Gulf of Mexico as spill cover up goes Orwellian http www naturalnews com 029130 Gulf of Mexico censorship html This is scary stuff folks Now we have a police state in America No one can deny it You can t argue the point anymore It is documented fact and it s happening right now in the Gulf Coast If you pick up a professional camera and start snapping photos of a BP refinery or a BP cleanup vessel or a beach with an oil boom on it you risk being followed detained questioned and intimidated And if you don t surrender your own rights and consent to an illegal search of your photos or film footage you will be hauled into a federal holding facility and held by the Department of Homeland Security until they feel like letting you go Your rights as a free citizen have now been obliterated America is now a fascist corporatocracy that answers to the financial interests of the corporations at the expense of the freedoms of the People What s really scary about this is that BP is a British corporation that is now controlling American law enforcement officials Didn t we fight a war to get rid of a British police state once already Didn t we declare our independence from British rule a couple hundred years ago Why are our public streets beaches and oceans now ruled once again by a conniving dishonest and downright ominous British corporate giant that has apparently gained control over our local law enforcement officials And if this is tolerated how far will this go Will BP soon set up roadblocks and checkpoints on public highways to search private vehicles for digital photos and video footage Can BP s private security goons arrest and detain you even if you re on public property Apparently they can See rather than tell the truth about what s happening in the Gulf BP has resorted to police state tactics to threaten the media and intimidate journalists threatening them with arrest detainment and felony crimes if they get close enough to snap photos of what s really going on in the Gulf Coast Why was ProPublica targeted for intimidation Probably because they just published a story exposing BP s 40 day release of toxic chemicals into the air from a Texas refinery The story is entitled BP Texas Refinery Had Huge Toxic Release Just Before Gulf Blowout and you can read it right here http www propublica org article bp texas refinery had huge toxic re The story reveals that the BP refinery being photographed by Lance Rosenfield illegally released 538 000 pounds of toxic chemicals including 17 000 pounds of benzene a known carcinogen 37 000 pounds of nitrogen oxides which contribute to respiratory problems and 186 000 pounds of carbon monoxide Salon com is also covering the police state tactics now being used by BP to stiff arm the media In a story called The BP Government Police State Salon reports http www salon com news opinion glenn greenwald 2010 07 05 bp These are true police state tactics and it s now clear that it is part of a pattern It s been documented for months now that BP and government officials have been acting in unison to block media coverage of the area It goes on to repeat text from Newsweek which states As BP makes its latest attempt to plug its gushing oil well news photographers are complaining that their efforts to document the slow motion disaster in the Gulf of Mexico are being thwarted by local and federal officials working with BP who are blocking access to the sites where the effects of the spill are most visible More than a month into the disaster a host of anecdotal evidence is emerging from reporters photographers and TV crews in which BP and Coast Guard officials explicitly target members of the media restricting and denying them access to oil covered beaches staging areas for clean up efforts and even flyovers Salon concludes with this surprisingly blunt statement The very idea that government officials are acting as agents of BP of all companies in what clearly seem to be unconstitutional acts to intimidate and impede the media is infuriating Obviously the U S Government and BP share the same interest preventing the public from knowing the magnitude of the spill and the inadequacy of the clean up efforts but this creepy police state behavior is intolerable On one hand it s fascinating to see the mainstream media suddenly discovering that we all live in a police state Gee Alex Jones and other freedom commentators have been warning about this for years and they all got written off as conspiracy theorists But it turns out they were dead on There is a conspiracy under way right now It s a conspiracy between the U S government and British Petroleum to cover up all evidence of what s really happening in the Gulf Coast Conspiracy is precisely the correct word to describe their behavior in all this and I can only wonder how long it will take before the mainstream media reluctant utters the C word on air What s happening is exactly a conspiracy The Random House Dictionary defines conspiracy as 1 an evil unlawful treacherous or surreptitious plan formulated in secret by two or more persons plot 2 a combination of persons for a secret unlawful or evil purpose 3 an agreement by two or more persons to commit a crime fraud or other wrongful act Does that sound like what s happening with BP and the federal government It sure does BP and the U S government are now clearly conspiring to use police powers to intimidate threaten detain and potentially imprison anyone who seeks to report on the truth of what s happening in the Gulf Coast And this in turn is the classic definition of what happens in a Police State From the same dictionary a Police State is a nation in which the police especially a secret police summarily suppresses any social economic or political act that conflicts with governmental policy Once again that s exactly what we re seeing in the Gulf Coast BP s private security goons are the new secret police And with the help of local and federal law enforcement officials they are actively suppressing the public s right to know the truth about what s happening there You see the real loss of what s happening with the BP oil catastrophe isn t merely the damage being caused by the oil it s the destruction of our freedoms as BP stream rolls the U S Constitution and its Bill of Rights to destroy our freedoms and once again place us under British rule You are now subjects not citizens once you enter the Gulf Coast zone in America Your rights have been stripped away and replaced by threats and intimidation backed by an armed band of corporate sponsored secret police You are witnessing the end of America the free and the rise of a fascist corporatocracy where all your rights and freedoms have been suspended until further notice And now shamelessly even local law enforcement isn t on your side anymore They ve sold out to their corporate slavemasters to the point where BP is now covering the salaries of nearly all the cops and Sheriffs working in certain areas there As Mac McClelland from Mother Jones reportedly said One parish has 57 extra shifts per week that they are devoting entirely to basically BP security detail and BP is paying the sheriff s office All this can only make you ask the obvious question What could possibly be happening in the Gulf Coast right now that s so scary that BP and the federal government is willing to destroy your rights in order to protect their secrets That s the relevant question here no Clearly there must be a very big secret in the Gulf of Mexico a secret so devastating to BP s financial future that it is willing to do almost anything to avoid that secret from getting out Why are beach cleanup workers being required to sign non disclosure agreements Why are journalists being threatened and intimidated Why are local cops being used as BP s private security force I can only shudder at the possible answers to this all important question A secret so dark and so dangerous that BP would do anything to keep it from getting out There can only be a couple of possible answers to this that would justify such police state actions Perhaps BP and the federal government is about to unleash a nuclear explosion to stop the oil outflow and they don t want anyone knowing about it until it s already done Perhaps the U S government is planning a multi state roundup and evacuation of the population to clear out the entire Gulf Coast region in anticipation of something big and dangerous such as a nuke or an oil soaked firestorm of a major U S city or a dangerous new chemical being dumped in the Gulf by BP etc Perhaps human bodies are washing up on the beaches for some unknown reason and the shock of it would be too much for the public to bear or maybe there s some other unimaginable reason none of us little people have thought of yet In any case the situation doesn t look pretty The very freedoms that we just celebrated on Independence Day have been obliterated by a British corporation which now rules our U S law enforcement and Department of Homeland Security I can only conclude that our government has been infiltrated by a foreign corporation that is now using our own government to enslave us by destroying the very freedoms we once fought so hard to acquire We are now living under a fascist corporatocracy and we are seeing first hand that these corporations will stop at nothing to protect their interests even if it means sacrificing our

"http://www.herbivoracious.com/2009/04/vegetarian-chili-recipe.html"	"8126"	"{""title"":""Best Vegetarian Chili Recipe Delicious Easy Healthy and Optionally Vegan Herbivoracious "",""body"":""Vegetarian chili with all the fixins Vegetarian chili is one of the first veggie entrees that pop into people s minds along with vegetarian lasagna of course It is a delicious easy and very nutritious meal in a bowl Add some tortillas or brown butter cornbread and a salad and you ll feel like a king It also can be made ahead it just gets better over the course of a couple of days and it freezes well There are many types of vegetarian chili some loaded up with a meat substitute like TVP or vegetarian ground beef or even bulghar wheat and others full of vegetables I m not a fan I like to highlight the beans cooking two or three varieties with a simple and flavorful tomato chili sauce and just a few aromatic vegetables to build the flavor base Multiple choice garnishes give each diner the opportunity to customize to their own palate This is my weekend version of the vegetarian chili recipe where I boil my own beans and make a tomato chili sauce from relative scratch Sometime soon I ll post a weeknight formula using more prepared ingredients But remember you can make this on the weekend and eat it all week Let s talk about heat level for a minute This sauce is flavored primarily with whole dried chili peppers You can control the spice by how many you put in and how hot they are I like to build a moderately spicy base and then add canned chipotle pepper to the nearly finished product as needed Don t omit them completely even if you don t like much heat because they provide a lot of fruity flavor and thicken the sauce Just go for milder varieties like ancho Aim for the lowest common denominator that your dining companions can handle and then offer hot sauces on the side like Tapatio or Tabasco or more adventurous brews Don t try to use fresh chilis they are for completely different types of dishes I use a mixture of pinto black and kidney beans in this recipe and soak them overnight You can get away without soaking them or do a quick soak for a couple of hours starting with hot water But honestly it isn t the same Overnight soaked beans just plain come out more tender and delicious and much better than from a can Vegetarian Chili From ScratchYields around 10 cups easily serving 5 and doubles or triples beautifully Vegetarian gluten free and vegan if you modify the garnishes Prep time 20 minutes Cook time 2 hours 1 5 cups dry pinto beans 1 cup dry black beans 1 2 cup dry kidney beans 3 to 6 dried chili pods any combination of ancho guajillo pasilla cascabel de arbol see above 1 small can chipotle pepper in adobo 28 oz can of crushed tomatoes 1 medium carrot finely diced 1 white or yellow onion finely diced 2 stalks celery finely diced 1 4 cup canola or other neutral vegetable oil 4 cloves garlic minced juice of 1 2 lemon salt For garnish green onion sliced thin mostly white parts only or white onion minced cilantro leaves grated cheddar or queso anejo or cotija sour cream or queso fresco lime wedges Carefully sort through the beans removing any extraneous material Rinse well Put in the pot you will eventually cook in add 2 quarts of water and soak overnight The next day drain the beans add water to cover by an inch or so and bring to a boil Reduce to a simmer and cook until the beans are very tender which could take 1 to 2 hours depending on their age Add water occasionally and stir to prevent any scorching When nearly done add 2 teaspoons of salt Meanwhile toast the chilis in a hot dry skillet until darkened on both sides Ventilate the room well while you do this it produces a rather intense smoke that some people find painful Allow to cool Hint use dispoable gloves for this step to avoid having spicy hands Break apart the chilis and dispose of the seeds and stems Add the chilis tomato sauce half of the adobo sauce from the can of chipotle and 1 teaspoon of salt to a blender and puree until very smooth This sauce should be pretty spicy because it is going in that huge pot of beans soon Saute the carrot onion and celery with 1 teaspoon of salt in the oil for about 10 minutes until soft Add the garlic and saute for 1 more minute Drain most of the liquid from the beans reserving a cup for later dilution if needed Add the chili sauce vegetables and lemon juice to the beans Bring back to a simmer and let cook for 10 minutes or so allowing the flavors to begin to marry Now taste If it needs more heat or a smoke add the rest of the adobo sauce If it needs a lot more heat you can puree the chipotle peppers and add them Add salt as needed You shouldn t be tasting a lemon flavor but there should be a subtle hint of acidity that wakes up the sauce If the whole thing is too thick you can dilute it with some of the reserved bean cooking liquid Serve your vegetarian chili forth with the garnishes listed above vegan, gluten-free, chili, mexican, tex-mex, healthy, vegetarian, veggie, veg, recipe, recipes, cooking, eating, dining, blog, restaurants, organic, cookbooks vegetarian chili

I don t suspect they will be slowing down especially with the holidays coming around the corner Can you believe it The holidays are coming and they will be here sooner then you think Ugh let s not even discuss it It brings on a mixed mess of excitement and anxiety Also I have decided to get into this crazy blog competition which I hope I will get to continue till the end By the way today is the last day to vote for round 1 so click on my face right over there on the right and vote I got an interesting dish planned for round 2 In the mean time I have cooked this beauty up to hold you over I had a bag of tortellini sitting in the freezer or awhile now and I had a feeling that it was time to bust it out and put it to good use The thing was I wasn t really in the mood for a red sauce I was feeling a white sauce would be better I knew I also wanted oozy gooey cheesy goodness I thought about it all morning I walked around the house while I cleaned thumping my head with my pointer finger saying Think think think It was a little reminiscent of Winne the Pooh which I am not sure is good or bad at the age of 31 I started to think about how much I love the fall and I would love to had a little fall twist to the dish Immediately I thought of sage and mushrooms and that is when it hit me mascarpone mozzarella sage and mushrooms I don t know why but I was so excited I grabbed my keys and purse and ran out to the grocery store Looking like a hot mess mind you I was in the middle of sweeping and mopping the floor after all I am almost sure I had some hair standing straight up since I hadn t put a brush in it yet However this moment wasn t about fashion that was the last thing on my mind Obviously since I was wearing paint splotched shorts out in public In fact if I had gone to Wal mart I am sure that I would have ended up on People of Wal mart luckily enough Target was closer I wore my biggest shades and a baseball cap and prayed no one would recognize me in my hot mess condition I quickly gathered all of my ingredients and headed back home Pre heat oven to 350 degrees Heat a skillet over medium high heat with 1 tbs of olive oil Add sliced sausage to the pan and cook until evenly browned Using a slotted spoon transfer the sausage to a plate and set aside In the same pan saute garlic and onions add mushrooms and saute at a medium heat until browned about 10 minutes You don t want to over cook the mushrooms because they are going to bake in the oven for an additional 30 minutes They should be brown but still firm Prepare tortellini according to package instructions Drain drizzle with olive oil cover with a kitchen towel and set aside until ready to use In a food processor combine mascarpone cheese and sage leaves process until smooth Add mascarpone cheese mixture and sausage to the mushrooms stir until smooth and creamy If using cream cheese it may be too thick add a little bit of chicken broth to thin the sauce to a desired consistency Season with salt and pepper to taste Don t be shy If you are afraid of over salting I recommend you get some kosher salt it is hard to over salt when you use kosher salt Add mushroom cream sauce to prepared tortellini and toss Spray an 8 x 8 baking dish with non stick spray Pour tortellini into baking dish Top with torn fresh mozzarella If you can get your hands on a fresh mozzarella I highly recommend it it melts so much better and smoother then packaged shredded or block mozzarella The streachy ooey gooeyness cannot be beat Place in the oven and bake for 30 minutes or until cheese is brown and bubbly Remove from oven and serve garnish with minced sage Check it out Mushrooms cream sausage and cheese Cheese people I love cheese Your family is going to rain hugs and kisses on you I promise I can t tell a lie When I took my first bite I was immediately beaming with pride This stuff was good and for just a moment I was over come with a delirious case of I think I am all that insert snapping fingers heat shake and stood proud on top of my royal blue counter top arm raised and wooden spoon in hand declaring myself the queen of creamy mushroom baked tortellini awesomeness Yeah I smacked my head on the drop ceiling but what did I care I was queen of creamy mushroom baked tortellini awesomeness Ok I didn t do that but I thought about it We all have our moments of grandiose illusions If I had had room I would have gone back for seconds and thirds but this is pretty filling The tortellini was perfectly cooked the mushrooms made it earthy and the sage gave me my first taste of fall The great thing is that this is easy to change up If you don t like sage use basil If you don t like mushrooms caramelize some cubed butternut squash in a pan with butter And if you want to get really creative I bet some chopped pecan and dry cranberries would be great in this Mmmmmm I think I see another variation in the future Print Recipe Creamy Sausage Mushroom Baked Tortellini 3 links mild

"http://tazadechocolate.blogspot.com/"	"4244"	"{""title"":""A Little Cup of Mexican Hot Chocolate "",""body"":""Calf s foot hominy and tripe are anything but remarkable And yet when some resourceful ranchera woman of long ago took some lowly cow offal and created a stew it became something that is truly greater than the sum of its parts Love or hate it menudo is a classic and you can t say that you really know Mexican food if you have never tasted it Out of all of Mexico s famous caldos this is the one that is most cherished for its restorative powers Feeling timid and weak Its rich spicy broth will put pelos hair on your chest even if you are a girl Sad with a broken heart The tender bites of menudo will console you better than ten mothers who think that telling you Why you crying mija T row him in a traash is consolation enough Nursing a magnificent hangover Eat some red hot menudo and you ll be singing to the radio on your way to work instead of calling in sick again or so I am told They are more like the day I got married and how I was so wound up that I forgot to eat breakfast Or how when my mother found out reminded me that if I didn t eat anything I was going to pass out right in the middle of the ceremony como una gallina asustada like some frightened hen Before I knew it my two sisters wrapped me wedding dress and all in a bed sheet while my mother proceeded to force her eye poppingly hot red menudo down my throat I m sure I got married with menudo breath that day but no matter I was the picture of blissful serenity as I walked down the aisle to meet my fate thanks to the menudo After the wedding reception the real party got started over at my new suegra s mom in law s house where toda la familia celebrated with her Sonora style white menudo and a glass of champagne An unusual pairing to say the least but why not Who says you can t have Mexican food with some fancy French wine Besides it was fabuloso Menudo is customarily eaten early the next day after an all night pachanga a big Mexican shindig but I suppose my cu\u00f1os y cu\u00f1as bros and sisters in law couldn t wait for morning That is how much they and most Mexicans love menudo The one thing we can agree on is this Menudo is wholly satisfying and is perfect just the way it is Thankfully I doubt that it will ever be tweaked or improved upon In other words it might never appear at your local Taco Bell or on the menu at one of those new gourmet read wildly expensive Mexican food eateries They might make the foodies happy but we probably will never eat there We ll take a homemade bowl of cow stomach menudo over a designer taco any day muchas gracias Some will pass up the opportunity to enjoy this fortifying stew but that s okay Entre menos burros hay m\u00e1s elotes With fewer burros there is more corn for the rest us to quote one of my mothers favorite dichos Or to put it very loosely don t be a burro and give menudo a try Red or Sonora Style White Menudo Menudo rojo o blanco al estilo Sonora To purchase the best tripe go to your local Mexican butcher usually early on a Friday You might not find any come Saturday morning The tripe should be white or a light cream with no strong odor Try buying tripe that has washed and scraped of all fat to save time Otherwise scrape off all traces of fat with a sharp knife If you soak the calf s foot pieces in a lemon juice water mixture for the allotted time I promise you the strong cooking odor some people complain about will be kept to a minimum Later your visitors will be surprised you spent the whole day cooking menudo because they won t smell a thing An added bonus very little excess fat Honeycomb tripe pictured above the most popular looks just like its name Most cooks use only honeycomb tripe or a combination of honeycomb and different styles of tripe such as Toalla which looks like a thick fluffy towel hence its name Not pictured The butcher ran out of it before I arrived See what I mean Lebrillo tripe is a lacey delicate looking tripe see picture right It is best used with a heartier tripe such as Toalla or Honeycomb Menudo is best served the same day or the next but no longer So don t cook a large batch unless you know it is going to be all eaten For this recipe I got a little lazy and used Mexican style hominy out a can Shh Don t tell my friend Eva but the next time I cook menudo I will show you how to cook hominy from menudo from scratch and I will post some pictures Dress up your menudo with chopped fresh cilantro sliced green onions dried Mexican oregano lemon wedges Chile piqu\u00edn tiny but intensely hot is the dried chile of choice for white menudo but crushed dried red chile flakes or hot sauce will do fine Don t forget to bring the corn tortillas and an open mind Ingredients 3 lbs honeycomb tripe or a combination with other kinds of tripe depending on your taste\u00bd calf s foot cut into piecesPlenty of water approximately 12 or 13 cups for the menudo The juice of one large or two small lemons About 2 cups cold water5 garlic cloves peeled1 large yellow onion cut in halfSalt to taste\u00bd teaspoon ground black pepper or to taste1 bay leaf \u00bd teaspoon ground cumin or to tasteAt least 2 cups canned Mexican style hominy to your tasteA small spoonful of white vinegar optionalRinse the tripe and the pieces of calf s foot with water and place them in a large pot Pour the juice from the large lemon over them with about 2 cups of cold water to cover and refrigerate for a few hours I let mine soak overnight Rinse the tripe and the calf foot pieces with cold water Place them in a large pot and fill with water to cover plus 1 \u00bd inches approximately 12 to 13 cups Add salt to taste plus the garlic cloves the onion ground black pepper and the bay leaf Bring to a boil then reduce the heat to medium low Loosely cover the pot and let it simmer for about 45 minutes or more Remove any scum that rises to the top with a large spoon Continue cooking for 5 hours more or until the tripe is nice and tender Total cooking time is about 6 hours Pour boiling water into the pot if the broth starts to evaporate Skim of any excess surface fat with a large spoon Prepare the Red Chile Sauce In the last hour of cooking pour at least 2 cups of the Red Chile Sauce into the pot according to your preference along with the hominy and the cumin No need to add Red Chile Sauce or cumin to the White Menudo Adjust the seasonings does the menudo need more salt Red Chile Sauce ground pepper or cumin Perhaps a small spoonful of white vinegar is just the thing to bring together all of the flavors Use large bowls to serve about 6 persons You can double or even triple this recipe if you want Once you get the hang of it you won t need a recipe at all Tip Start cooking your menudo at around midnight and let it simmer over a low flame all night long Make sure that there is more than the usual amount of water in the pot Wake up early the next morning check the water level and dump the Red Chile Sauce and the hominy into the pot and go back to bed for a little while You ll wake up to freshly cooked menudo Red Chile Sauce RecipeIngredients 8 dried Ancho chiles10 dried New Mexico chiles8 dried California chilesWater Directions Cut the stems from all the chiles Then slice them open and remove all the seeds Place the chiles in a saucepan and cover them with water Place a lid on the saucepan and boil for about 5 or 6 minutes or until the chiles are nice and soft Remove the chiles but do not discard the water In small batches take the chiles along with some of the water and whirl in a blender at high speed Now use a strainer to remove the tiny bits of peel Do this twice to make a super smooth sauce It should pour like spaghetti sauce If the sauce is too thick add a little more water until it does Makes about 3 cups Save any unused portion for other dishes "",""url"":""tazadechocolate

natural and should not be labeled as such the US Food and Drug Administration FDA has said The decision is likely to cause a massive stir in the food and beverage industry where a discreet battle has been raging over the status of the controversial sweetener High fructose corn syrup HFCS is derived from corn and used primarily to sweeten beverages The trade group Corn Refiners Association and numerous industry members have long maintained that HFCS is a natural sweetener However the sugar industry is more critical as HFCS comes into direct competition with sugar as a sweetener Industry group Sugar Association as well as consumer groups such as the Center for Science in the Public Interest categorically maintain that HFCS cannot be considered natural because its chemical bonds are broken and rearranged in the manufacturing process The debate raged on for one simple reason FDA does not define the term natural and it has therefore been left open to different interpretations However in response to an inquiry from FoodNavigator USA com the regulatory agency examined the composition of HFCS which it said is produced using synthetic fixing agents Consequently we would object to the use of the term natural on a product containing HFCS the agency s Geraldine June said in an e mail to FoodNavigator USA com June is Supervisor of the Product Evaluation and Labeling team at FDA s Office of Nutrition Labeling and Dietary Supplements FDA on natural FDA has received two petitions to define the term natural one from the Sugar Association and one from bakery firm Sara Lee Although the agency had not provided a formal response to these petitions it told this publication that it has no plans to define the term in the near future due to limited resources We re not sure how high of an issue it is for consumers it said Nevertheless FDA does have a longstanding policy regarding the use of the term This states that a natural product is one that has not had any artificial or synthetic substances added to the product that would not normally be expected to be in the food including artificial flavors or color additives regardless of source FDA also does not currently restrict the use of the term natural except on products that contain added color synthetic substances and flavors as provided for in Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations CFR section 101 22 FDA on HFCSAlthough FDA provides no definition or detailed guidelines for the use of the term natural it said it has a system in place for manufacturers with doubts to approach it and ask for guidance on the use of particular ingredients Under this system FoodNavigator USA com submitted an inquiry about HFCS FDA responded that HFCS is prepared from a high dextrose equivalent corn starch hydrolysate by partial enzymatic conversion of glucose dextrose to fructose using an insoluble glucose isomerase enzyme preparation The glucose isomerase enzyme preparation is fixed rendered insoluble using safe and suitable immobilization fixing agents it said The use of synthetic fixing agents in the enzyme preparation which is then used to produce HFCS would not be consistent with our policy regarding the use of the term natural said Geraldine June Moreover the corn starch hydrolysate which is the substrate used in the production of HFCS may be obtained through the use of safe and suitable acids or enzymes Depending on the type of acid s used to obtain the corn starch hydrolysate this substrate itself may not fit within the description of natural and therefore HCFS produced from such corn starch hydrolysate would not qualify for a natural labeling term she concluded HFCS and industryAlthough FDA s conclusion may not be welcome by some industry members who would have liked to have promoted their HFCS containing products as natural it will at least prevent any future misinterpretations Last year for example both Cadbury Schweppes and Kraft faced lawsuits after making natural label claims on beverages that contained high fructose corn syrup Both companies changed the labeling of their products before any legal action was taken The market for natural The quest for natural foods and beverages has burgeoned on the back of an overall consumer move towards healthier nutrition According to Mintel s Global New Products Database All Natural was the third most frequent claim made on food products launched in the US in 2007 appearing on 2 617 products It ranked fourth most popular claim for beverages used on 542 items In Europe 878 All Natural food products and 509 beverage products were launched last year Additionally the Natural Marketing Institute reported in 2004 that 63 percent of US consumers have a preference for natural foods and beverages In 2006 a Harris Interactive survey found that 83 percent of people wanted a government definition of the term If you would like to comment on this article please contact lorraine heller at

Nancy Rones22 ways to tackle life s biggest energy zappers Every day 2 2 million Americans complain of being tired Most of us chalk it up to having too much to do and not enough time to do it in especially during extra busy periods But often the true culprits are our everyday habits what we eat how we sleep and how we cope emotionally Read on for some simple recharging changes that can help you tackle all of the energy stealers in your life Energize Your Diet Why is it that filling up on pasta or Chinese food for lunch leaves us snacky and sleepy an hour later Or that falling short on fluids makes us forgetful and foggy Fact is eating habits play a powerful role in how well we function on every level Below six top fatigue fighting nutrition strategies to chew on Have breakfast even if you don t feel hungry You ll be a lot perkier Studies show that people who eat breakfast feel better both mentally and physically than those who skip their morning meal British researchers at Cardiff University even found that spooning up a bowl of breakfast cereal every morning is associated with lower levels of the stress hormone cortisol Eat every three to four hours Having three smallish meals and two snacks throughout the day can keep your blood sugar and energy levels stable all day long says Roberta Anding R D a spokesperson for the American Dietetic Association ADA Note the word smallish Supersized meals demand more of your energy to digest which can leave you feeling lethargic At each mini meal get a mix of carbohydrates which the body uses for energy protein which helps sustain energy if needed and healthy fats like those found in fish nuts and olives these fats and protein contribute to meal satisfaction so you don t go hunting for sweets an hour later and wind up with a short lived sugar high and subsequent crash A few meal ideas a low fat yogurt parfait with berries and a couple of tablespoons of whole grain granola salmon over mixed greens with whole grain crackers and beef tenderloin with a baked sweet potato and asparagus Fill up on more fiber Fiber has a time releasing effect on carbs so they enter your bloodstream at a slow and steady pace giving your energy staying power says Anding When choosing your mini meals see above include fiber filled options that add up to the daily recommended 25 to 30 grams of fiber the average person gets only between 10 and 15 grams Some suggestions a bowl of raisin bran 5 grams of fiber per cup black beans and cheese wrapped in a multigrain tortilla beans have 7 5 grams per 1 2 cup one tortilla has 5 grams air popped popcorn 3 6 grams per 3 cups an apple with the skin 3 3 grams and whole wheat spaghetti 6 3 grams per cup Fuel your brain with omega 3s Found in fatty fish such as tuna and salmon walnuts and canola oil these essential fatty acids play a role in keeping brain cells healthy and helping you feel mentally alert Another potential bonus Omega 3s encourage the body to store carbs as glycogen the storage form of glucose blood sugar and the body s main source of stored fuel rather than as fat Stay hydrated Water makes up the majority of your blood and other body fluids and even mild dehydration can cause blood to thicken forcing the heart to pump harder to carry blood to your cells and organs and resulting in fatigue Also ample fluids keep energy fueling nutrients flowing throughout the body says Nancy Clark R D author of Nancy Clark s Sports Nutrition Guidebook To gauge your hydration Clark recommends monitoring how often you urinate You should be going every two to four hours and your urine should be clear or pale yellow in color Tip Besides drinking more you can also consume foods that naturally contain water such as yogurt broccoli carrots and juicy fruits like watermelons oranges and grapefruits Watch caffeine intake after noon Typically consuming a moderate amount of caffeine 200 to 300 mg the amount found in two to three cups of coffee can make you more energetic and alert in the hours following says Anthony L Komaroff M D a professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School But when caffeine is consumed in large quantities or anytime in the afternoon or evening the quality of your sleep that night can take a nosedive leaving you with heavy eyelids the next day One caution for those who are highly sensitive to caffeine Although switching to a decaf latte in the afternoon sounds like the answer researchers at the University of Florida found that out of 22 decaffeinated coffee beverages tested all but one contained some caffeine 22 ways

google com article ALeqM5gy FocuLcPyslOqVeaOFan8yo7eQD8VM3A680 I just read this I m sure most of you all know about it by now it seems like something that would hit massive airtime on the major networks If you are religious close your browser right now If you think your feelings might be hurt by someone questioning your beliefs close your browser right now Last warning It s painfully obvious that The Angriest Pharmacist is not a religious person by any stretch of the imagination When I was a child we attended a Methodist church While in high school we went to a Baptist hellfire and brimstone \u00c2 Church My mother still goes there I stopped the day I turned 18 it was kind of an unspoken\u00c2 agreement between myself and my mother I wish she d stop going and come to her senses about the bullshit this guy spews \u00c2 I wasn t ever Baptized but I consider myself to be affluent in the beliefs of the church and all opposing viewpoints Let s just say this on my census form \u00c2 I put Jedi These two parents especially the mother need to be jailed At the very least her\u00c2 three other children need to be put under protective custody Why She cost this little girl her life because she trusted her imaginary friend more than she trusted a doctor she could see converse with and touch If this lady would have told the press she didn t take her child to the doctor because Satan told her not to we d have her ass institutionalized But since it was attributed to God and God is associated with light and goodness it s okay because her intentions were in the right place What s the difference Some of the worst fuckups in the history of mankind were based on good intentions and blind faith If you need them pointed out you re a fucking fool I will admit that people have been dying of Diabetic Ketoacidosis for thousands of years If this little girl would have been born in 1897 rather than 1997 she would have died in her home all the same The family would have prayed and she would have died The issue here surrounds the fact that it s 2008 Medical science has increased the life expectancy of a white female to nearly 80 years which is far more than 11 But the thing that solidifies that this bitch needs jailed is that several family members had been trying to get her to take the child to the hospital for days and she prayed Other s common sense had taken hold over faith yet mommy s did not Daddy s did not That s because they are retarded A mother s common sense maternal instinct has to exist right Nay a HUMAN BEING S COMMON SENSE must exist right \u00c2 A child is suffering from nausea vomiting excessive thirst loss of appetite and weakness for over a month and you do nothing but talk quietly\u00c2 to yourself and hope the child s pancreas secretes more insulin Did you get an answer No No one talked back to you You sure as shit got a response I ve heard people say that losing a child is the worst thing that can emotionally happen to a human being In this case I hope that s true We did learn one truth God does not replace Beta Cells upon special request maybe she needed a PA Some might say to me you are a faithless piece of shit I d kick your ass right now if I could find you Actually I d bet most Christians would Christians at least from my neck of the woods are very violent They d attack beat up\u00c2 an atheist just like they would a pedophile They would beat a person with the very\u00c2 book that preaches in part about tolerance hope love and charity Christians have been fighting and killing in the name of God for well about 2 thousand years now I wouldn t expect much change anytime soon Especially now that we have some new sins to fight about Anyway I would challenge the above statement about myself I am not without faith hope or love tolerance of others I m working on it I hold that I have an abundance of all three I have faith in my abilities my Brothers my significant other the goodness of a stranger just to name a few I have unwaivering hope I always hope for better for others myself those in need want I have hope that the future is better than\u00c2 today I hope that our children learn from our mistakes and I have faith that we can raise them to meet that challenge Love one cannot work in the trenches without love Love for the patient seeking counsel or the cancer patient seeking relief and comfort Love for the person sleeping next to them each night Yes I have love and it is the greatest of these You may call The Angriest Pharmacist an atheist but I base my life and the way I live off of Christian teachings morals parables and principles I may be more Christian than some of\u00c2 the Christians reading this post I just question the existence of one more god than they do

line - loneplacebo loneplacebo how to download youtube videos via the command line"",""body"":""I don t purport this tutorial as being the ideal way to download Youtube videos to your computer A simple Google search will lead you to an assortment of options that requires less technical expertise However if you re like me and are relatively new to the command line think your OS without the GUI and a mouse this might be an interesting way to accomplish something relatively useful download Youtube videos to your computer and also learn how to directly communicate with your computer In this tutorial I ll be using a command line program called youtube dl Sorry Window users This walkthrough is tailored for Mac Linux users However there is a nice write up here which you can follow as well Working with Terminal The Basics I m no command line genius maybe just a hair above a beginner I know how to navigate my way through the system directory output files folders copy delete stuff and open applications Thankfully that should be enough for completing this guide First download and save the youtube dl program to your computer here You should right click the link and select Save Link As and save the file with the Python extension py Next open up Terminal on your Mac Type in cd usr local NOTE This is a hidden directory on your computer system where some of the core programs are being handled Thus I urge extra caution when working here I also like to use the ls command which outputs a list of all the files and directories I can navigate to next based on my current location Go ahead and try it now Next type into Terminal open bin Click to enlarge A new Finder window should appear containing a bunch of cryptic looking files The reason why we have to navigate to this folder via Terminal is because by default it is a hidden system folder meaning it can t be reached via Finder alone There is a Terminal command to display all hidden files by default but it is generally advised not to do so Press Authenticate and enter your login credentials Paste your youtube dl py file now in the bin folder you are in A pop up will appear telling you that you don t have permission to do so Select Authenticate and enter your login password Verify that the file was correctly saved to the directory Currently in Terminal we are sitting inside the usr local directory Next type in cd bin This moves you into the bin folder where you had saved the youtube dl py file to in the previous step A short intro to file permissions File permissions determine which users can perform a certain action on specific files and directories There are read r write w and execute x permissions and are assigned to three types of users a user u b group g and c other o Read the following articles for a more further details The reason why I mention file permissions is because you will need to edit the file permissions for the youtube dl py file currently residing in your bin folder At the moment the file only has read and write access to the user which is you You can view the permissions using the ls command mentioned earlier by including the l option which displays extra details So typing in the following ls l while in the bin directory should display something like this rwxrwxr x 1 tonyhue staff 66816 Jan 10 2011 twdiff rwxrwxr x 1 tonyhue staff 77120 Jan 10 2011 twfind rw r xr x 1 tonyhue staff 139584 Oct 20 18 33 youtube dl py There should be other files but I only included the last three which includes the youtube dl py file You can also check the permissions for a specific file directory by using the g option ls lg youtube dl py In order for the program to run you need to give yourself execution permission Currently youtube dl py has read and write access To add execution permission we will use the chmod command by typing in chmod u x youtube dl py Verify that the correct permissions for the file contain read write and execution permission by typing in ls lg youtube dl py Almost there Congrats You ve hopefully made it this far unscathed After modifying the permissions for the youtube dl py file you can now start downloading Youtube videos to your computer from the command line Just type in youtube dl py youtube video link Don t include the bracket parenthesis Things should be working properly if Terminal outputs something that looks like this youtube w639H9ZUqZw Downloading video webpage youtube w639H9ZUqZw Downloading video info webpage youtube w639H9ZUqZw Extracting video information download Destination w639H9ZUqZw mp4 download 100 0 of 9 53M at 9 06M s ETA 00 00 Don t fret if you start getting error messages Try restarting Terminal and attempting again Verify that youtube dl py has rwx permissions Also check to see if you remembered to include the py extension If all has gone according to plan you should be able to find your newly downloaded video in your Users folder Yeah I know Terrible place to put it amiright What else Pat yourself on the back once more You ve successfully downloaded a Youtube video to your computer Youtube dl has a number of available options to customize the video you download such as changing the video filename to the video s title instead of its id Also the program can also download videos from other sources besides Youtube including Vimeo Daily Motion and Metacafe The sky is the limit majoring in technology downloading videos off youtube is such a common ritual on the internet, but how about doing it via the command line? command line, terminal, youtube videos, download youtube

or invented explanations that are retold so often that they are accepted as truth They should not be that way and they have no place in any individual s fitness routine Below are 14 of the most common myths on fitness exercises and workouts that you and I should know about When you stop working out muscles will turn into fat It s the most typical workout myth in the world Muscle has never and will never turn into fat and neither does fat turn into muscle During weight training more energy is required hence a bigger appetite When a person stops working out the need for extra energy stops as well But because the stomach size has increased due to a bigger appetite the need to feel full has become a habit Those extra calories that were once used as fuel while training is now stored as fat It may seem like the bulk of muscle has turned into fat but the truth is that the body became fatter due to eating more than previously needed Be it protein or carbohydrates both turns into fat when not used Cutting back on training requires you to cut back on food consumption as well Food eaten after 8 at night will turn into body fat Not entirely true For people who workout during the later part of a day it is important to eat accordingly Whenever there is a need for the body to repair and rebuild fuel is needed and the body most actively repairs during during sleep However it is more important to eat healthier foods during the later part of a day like lean meat unsaturated fats vegetables and fruits to avoid the risk of unwanted fat deposits Give the body at least 2 hours to digest the food before going to bed Six pack abs equal six hundred sit ups and crunches daily Everyone has six pack abs Abdominal exercises do not lead to clearly visible six pack abs but fat reduction does The first place that fat goes to in the body is the last place fat comes off Tummy for men and hips butt thighs for women Spot reduction of fat has never and will never work Here are some of the lesser known facts about losing weight that people ought to know about A six pack abs is a definite want for any man working out for it is a social muscle Ab exercises will definitely strengthen and tone the abs but does not rid the fat A better use of time would be to spend it on interval cardio sessions and making sure that proper food is fed to the body I actually have a personal digital body fat analyzer that I use from time to time that gives me a rough idea of my body s current state Accuracy may not be as good as a DXA but it s good enough for me You can easily get one at less than US 10 from online auction sites like ebay Stretching and warm up isn t necessary I hit the gym everyday And everyday I ll take up 10 minutes to stretch and warm up my body from head to toe It is necessary to avoid sprains and injuries Even after a good day s workout I stretch It greatly reduces the severity of DOMS delayed onset muscle soreness which will be pretty much appreciated the morning after Here are 20 more solid reasons why warm up and stretching is important Supplements will boost muscle growth and strength in no time There are only 2 ways to make the most gains in mass and might A good training program A well planned out diet Time and energy should be focused on the 2 methods mentioned above rather than on supplements that claim to be able to bring out the Arnold in you Some supplements may have serious and irreversible side effects if taken wrongly For example steroids taken wrongly may lead to a loss of appetite constipation intestinal irritation vomiting nose bleeding headaches increased aggression and even liver cancer It s way better to attain the results we want naturally Think safe think long term Our body s health should not be taken lightly Weight training will make women look beefy To look beefy you d need testosterone Lots of it Hundreds and hundreds of nanograms per deciliter of blood The average testosterone levels for a human being are Male 300 1 000 ng dl Female 20 80 ng dl Women just do not have the testosterone levels necessary to look like The Rock in Scorpion King As a matter of fact weight training is the fastest and easiest way for women to look leaner sculpted and toned Light to moderate weights and many repetitions are the most effective for toning and strengthening and make you look like Megan Fox in Transformers Vegetarians will not make it in bodybuilding It s so wrong There is Bill Pearl who won Mr Universe twice first in 1953 kicking Sean Connery s ass 6th and in 1971 before retiring 1951 Mr America Roy Hilligenn is another perfect example who still looks young as hell at 77 years old You can see more of today s vegetarian bodybuilders at veganbodybuilding com Vegetarians get their protein from nuts seeds cereals and legumes B12 vitamin and iodin are 2 other essential nutrients available through seaweed Your body weakens with age It s all in the mind Think old and you ll look old and act old The fact is body building doesn t only improve your physique and rejuvenates your spirit but also gives you a healthy perspective on people and the world around Some of the older bodybuilders include With regular exercise weight training and a low fat diet you ll gain increased energy levels leaner body mass and an optimum body fat percentage With the big 90 around the corner people still do experience renewed strength increased mobility stronger bones and greater flexibility by exercising The longer time I spend at the gym the fitter I become For me it s no longer than 60 minutes 3 times a week The focus here is on efficiency and effectiveness like this super cool 15 minutes workout that works every muscle in your body An average bodybuilder does not spend more than 1 hour working out People who just don t have the time to workout that much will lose interest and motivation to exercise if the myth were true The point is any exercise at all done correctly is better than none If I don t feel pain in the morning I didn t work out hard enough When we lift weights our muscle fibers will tear a little Muscle soreness is expected but normally heals within a week Anything more than a week is an indication of over working out Committing to a fitness program will eventually lead the muscle into getting used to it Changing a fitness program regularly will ensure that all muscles are worked on and experiencing growth However what happens in the gym is only meant to PROMOTE muscle growth The REAL process begins only when a person is RECOVERING Pain should not be used as a measurement of a workout session s effectiveness Some soreness yes but not pain Always remember to stretch before and after Get enough rest and work on different muscle groups on different days Rest a day if the muscles are still sore shoulders upper back arms chest abs lower back legs Avoid drinking water when your body is over heated An average human body s water content is 60 for men and 55 for women In my body 86 out of 143 pounds is water If the body s water content drops 5 it s already considered dehydration An hour of vigorous exercise is enough to drain a quart 1 liter Drinking before during and after is pretty important During exercise muscles generate heat that will cause a rise in body temperature This heat is doused by water when it is carried in the bloodstream and pushed to the surface as bullets of sweat It continues to drain water from the body until it is replenished Thirst is already a sign of dehydration Drink a cup every 15 minutes Keeps the muscles oiled and the body productive There is no need for doctors if I don t plan on biting off more than I can chew If you have never done any resistance training before in your life and you re above 40 it s best to consult your doc Go for a physical exam that examines the temperature blood pressure pulse and respiratory rate Things that concern your cardiovascular fitness blood cholesterol levels and medical history should also be taken into account Ask doc about the best exercise given your medical profile The prime time for exercising and working out is in the mornings Correction The best time to exercise is the time that works with the individual s body clock and fits their busy days People working out in the morning are more likely to stick to their fitness plans as they are able to get it in before the various demands of life compete for their time Many many people believe that the best way to lose fat is to start pushing your body right after waking up in the mornings on an empty stomach I say no Exercise is meant for toning the muscle and burning fat Inability to draw energy from the main source will only force the body to go to other sources of energy which are your muscles and fat More muscles are used up as fuel as their composition is much simpler compared to fat It is okay to cover a week s worth of workout during the weekend It s also much better spreading a workout all over the week instead of pounding the body during weekends A weekend warrior will lose out on other health benefits Blood pressure and glucose levels are temporarily lowered during each exercise which are beneficial in the long run Exercising regularly also keeps a person s appetite consistent "",""url"":""odyb fitness myths about fitness exercises

Overall Health Alice G Walton Health your body's internal clock and how it affects your overall health - alice g. walton - health - the atlantic your body's internal clock and how it affects your overall health"",""body"":""Not getting enough sleep leaves us tired during the day But the body s clock also affects mood mental alertness hunger and heart function Jiri Hera Shutterstock We all feel the ebb and flow of daily life the daily rhythms that shape our days The most basic daily rhythm we live by is the sleep wake cycle which for most is related to the cycle of the sun It makes us feel sleepy as the evening hours wear on and wakeful as the day begins Sleep wake and other daily patterns are part of our circadian rhythms circum means around and dies day which are governed by the body s internal or biological clock housed deep within the brain But research has been finding that the body s clock is responsible for more than just sleep and wakefulness Other systems like hunger mental alertness and mood stress heart function and immunity also operate on a daily rhythm The existence of the biological clock can be particularly apparent when it s off kilter Jet lag and shift work can throw our normal patterns out of whack and take a toll on physical and mental health Even shifting the clock an hour forward or backward when daylight savings time begins or ends can disrupt our biological clocks Disrupting our body s natural cycles can cause problems Studies have found there are more frequent traffic accidents and workplace injuries when we spring forward and lose an hour of sleep Heart patients are at greater risk for myocardial infarction in the week following the Daylight Savings time shift But even more significant is that science continues to discover important connections between a disrupted clock and chronic health issues from diabetes to heart disease to cognitive decline It turns out that the same genes and biological factors that govern our internal clock are also involved in how other body systems operate and break down It can be hard to determine whether a disrupted clock leads to health problems or whether it s the other way around We re beginning to understand more about how the clock interacts with and helps govern the function of other systems and affects our overall health In fact keeping your body s daily cycle on an even keel may be one of the best things you can do for your overall health YOUR BODY WANTS TO RUN LIKE A SWISS WATCH The idea of a biological clock may sound like a quaint metaphor but there is actually a very distinct brain region that is charged with keeping time It is an area called the suprachiasmatic nucleus or SCN situated right above the point in the brain where the optic nerve fibers cross This location enables the SCN to receive the cues it needs from light in the environment to help it keep time But genes also influence the body s clock and circadian rhythms The system requires both types of input light and genes to keep it on track To stay on the 24 hour cycle the brain needs the input of sunlight through the eyes to reset itself each day When humans are allowed to run off their body s clock apart from input from the sun by being kept in continuous darkness the body s daily cycle tends to lengthen to about 25 hours And when people or animals lack the genes that help control the clock s cycle their sleep wake cycles can stray even further or be absent completely The need for both kinds of cues light and genes make the biological clock a classic example of how genes and the environment work in tandem to keep the system functioning well Our Behaviors and Body Functions Run on Cycle Melatonin is one hormone responsible for our body s daily cycle When night falls and there is less light input to the SCN the production of melatonin the hormone responsible for making us feel sleepy goes up When it s dark more melatonin is secreted which signals the brain to go into sleep mode When the sun rises melatonin secretion is inhibited and the brain s awake circuits resume Other systems also follow a daily rhythm many of which are controlled by hormones and other compounds that receive cues from the biological clock For example the hormones responsible for hunger and metabolism rise and fall over the course of the day The chemicals involved in immune system function also vary Compounds that encourage the inflammatory response rise at night which is why fevers tend to spike then and those that inhibit it rise during the day This is likely because the body is better at fighting infection while it is at rest and energy can be poured into the effort rather than into other functions And activity of the stress response system particularly in secretion of the stress hormone cortisol is reduced during the nighttime hours and heightened in the early morning Although there are certain areas of the body like the heart that are able to govern their own function to some degree there is strong evidence that the body clock plays a major role in controlling many of these fluctuations such as in blood sugar over the 24 hour period ENVIRONMENTAL DISRUPTIONS TO THE BODY S CLOCK Some of the best knowledge we have about the roles the biological clock plays in our health come from instances in which the cycle gets out of sync This can happen for different reasons and we re just starting to understand them in greater detail Sometimes we do things ourselves that disrupt our normal rhythms like flying to a distant time zone Sometimes it s other factors like genes or biology that play a role Jet Lag Flying across the country on the red eye is a prime example of how we can disrupt our own clocks and a far more extreme example than the spring forward fall back ritual in many parts of the U S When jet lag sets in we feel disoriented foggy and sleepy at the wrong times of day because after changing time zones our body clock tells us it s one time and the outside environment tells us it s another In fact jet lag can be considered one type of circadian rhythm disorder It can be treated simply be allowing the body to adjust to the new time although it may take several days for external cues light to help the internal clock catch up or fall back with its new cycle Shift Work Shift work is another example of how we can get ourselves off cycle and this too can develop into a circadian rhythm disorder over the long term People who work the night shift not only have a hard time with their sleep patterns feeling sleepy at work or experiencing insomnia during the day but other systems in their bodies can also feel the effects and they can be chronic It s not been clear exactly why this connection exists but weight gain or metabolic changes may be involved These phenomena underline how particular behaviors or lifestyles can affect the body s clock but there are other factors at play like genetics and body chemistry not getting enough sleep leaves us tired during the day. but the body's clock also affects mood, mental alertness, hunger, and heart function. not getting enough sleep leaves us tired during the day. but the body's

"",""body"":""February 25 2010 There are people today who condemn society for how cut off we ve become from each other too many machines they say people don t talk anymore But the way I see it technology has just allowed us to cut all of the useless people who needlessly ruin our day out of the picture Unfortunately we ll always have to tell Vancouver taxi drivers where to go but here s a tribute to the charming people we no longer have to interact with thanks to technology Angry Bank Teller Some might mourn the loss of the days when you would wait in line at the bank chatting with the other customers in anticipation of being served by your friendly bank teller To those people I ask do you also miss being on the wrong end of some surly teller s bad day Sure Angry Bank Teller hasn t had the best day either but that doesn t mean he gets to take it out on you Judging by how many countries were simultaneously trying to invent the technology for ATM s it s clear that people have been trying to break up with the bank teller for quite some time The first automatic teller machine first appeared in 1972 in the United Kingdom As of August 2006 it was estimated that there were 1 5 million in use You can now find them in cruise ships on U S Navy Battle cruisers and as high up as Nagchu County Tibet The wide scale adoption of this technology has freed us from the bank line bottle neck and the weary judging stare of the person between you and your money These days thanks to technology you never again have to endure the anger of a frustrated bank employee Heck even the ATM has become obsolete You can shift your money from home by way of online banking order that pizza and pay with plastic when your food arrives This future in now and it is beautiful The Absent minded Waitress How many times have you sat there in a restaurant getting the worst service of your life and thought to yourself It s not hard A machine could do it Well your prayers have been answered Enter the automated restaurant People have been trying to cut wait staff out of the picture for ages Japan s conveyor belt sushi craze in the 1970s almost did it Sushi chefs would make fresh sushi and set it on a conveyor belt that would travel the length of the restaurant where the clients would grab whatever they wanted Unfortunately patrons still needed a waiter if they wanted something specific The first fully automated restaurant opened in Germany in 2007 Instead of an inattentive bubbled headed waiter or waitress that can t even get water right the customer just plugs their order into a touch screen computer and food is brought directly to tables by gravity operated ramps Since this breakthrough automated ordering has caught on all over the world In London one restaurant installed a touch sensitive computer system that projects the menu a picture of the meal you re going to order and a host of other things on the table It s only a matter of time before you never have to tip for bad service again The Penny Woman and the Surly Teen Clerk You re standing in the checkout line at the grocery store You can feel your blood pressure rising as the apathetic acne faced checkout clerk slowly counts their way through the mountain of pennies the old woman in front of you has dropped on the conveyor belt You momentarily contemplate committing seppuku before you remember that you live in the 21st century self checkout exists and you never have to deal with these people ever again Since 2003 when the installation of these little wonders became ubiquitous people have had the option to go it alone in the grocery store You can revel in the feeling of privacy these little machines provide while you buy your giant box of condoms tube of lubricant and suggestive magazines and bask in the knowledge that you the penny woman and that judgmental teenager won t be seeing each other any time soon The Persistent Telemarketer Wait you might say didn t technology doom us to this life of being called in the middle of dinner or when you ve just gotten into a bath Wasn t it responsible for cursing us with unending offers to improve our cell phone plans Well yes and no Technology created the world of telemarketers but in 1988 it also gave us call display and more recently the no call list They may have the auto dialer but they need you to pick up the phone to bother you and if their call is coming from a 1 866 number it s just not going to happen In the past these vultures capitalized on the fact that you didn t know if the phone call coming in was from the hospital telling you that your dad had been in an accident or maybe Ed McMahon telling you that you were the next winner You would pick up just to know and ah ha they had you These days you know exactly who s calling you The power is in your hands Even better the fantastic invention of call display and cell phone plans now enables you to dodge those people in your life who reach out and touch you a little too often Let s be honest you don t need to talk to your mother in law three times a day The Judgmental Ticket Attendant There s no such thing as bad taste but try telling that to the ticket attendant sitting on the other side of the glass staring you down just because you need to see how bad the new Uwe Boll movie really is It s your money and your time and you should be able to spend them without feeling bad about yourself And today you can The technology behind automated ticket machines is really just an extension of the stuff used in automatic bank machines Change the software a little add a touch screen and voila Now you can indulge in even your most embarrassing music or movie pleasures without the extra helping of shame No one will judge you for wearing sweat pants to a movie it s not like the actors can see or your penchant for 80s cock rock anymore Included in this category are the parking attendants who pass judgment on your old ugly but serviceable car The Ignorant Secretary People moan about automated call answering services Why should I press 1 to be served in English Then you have to listen to a long menu of options Well to those asking this question perhaps it s been a while since you had a run in with the Ignorant Secretary She s the one with the nasal voice who isn t really listening to what you re asking but even if she were she wouldn t know how to answer your question anyways When you get upset because she doesn t know simple things like the office hours or some scheduling detail she gets angry because you are being rude It s been a while since most of us had to deal with this person and so many have come to hate the slow efficiency of the automated answering service But as much as you loath waiting through a list of touch tone options and the lack of human contact at least the answering service always has the right answer and it never gets angry with you Related posts Humiliating Reasons People Have Been Arrested Part Deux Last year we did a piece

processing"",""body"":""Recursion is an important programming technique that lends itself to a variety of areas not least of which is creating interesting visual images In brief recursion is a technique for breaking a complex problem into smaller and simpler versions of itself this is called the recursive step until the problem is trivial to solve this trivial case is called the base case This Codebox a variety of sketches that will help you explore this fun and interesting technique using simple geometrical concepts Many artists have used recursive themes in their work particularly M C Escher and Rene Magritte This first sketch shows how to create images in the style of Piet Mondrian who is best known for his compositions of colorful rectangles The following program uses recursion to creates a faux Mondrian The base case is simple all you do is draw a filled rectangle with a thick black border the rectangle s color is selected from a small set of primary colors red white yellow etc The recursive step is to break this rectangle and all subsequent rectangles into 4 smaller rectangles by selecting a random point in its interior The following figure should give you an idea of how it works The output will look something like this Finally here s the sketch mondrian pde The piet function is the heart of the program and illustrates how most recursive programs work Here it is Draw a Mondrian inspired image using recursion void piet int x0 int y0 int x1 int y1 int N if N 0 Base case draw a colorful rectangle with a thick black border int sw 3 this is the stroke width for the rectangle s border color c ff0000 00ff00 0000ff ffff00 ffffff Mondrian color palatte fill c int random c length strokeWeight sw rect x0 y0 x1 x0 sw y1 y0 sw else Recursive step break the current rectangle into 4 new random rectangles int i int random x0 x1 int j int random y0 y1 piet x0 y0 i j N 1 upper left rectangle piet i y0 x1 j N 1 upper right rectangle piet x0 j i y1 N 1 lower left rectangle piet i j x1 y1 N 1 lower right rectangle The function accepts 5 arguments the coordinates of the upper left hand corner of a rectangle x0 and y0 the coordinates of the lower right hand corner x1 and x2 and the current recursive depth N The function does two basic things First it tests to see if it s reached the base case when N 0 If so then all it does is draw a rectangle that is randomly colored from the basic Mondrian palette of colors red greed blue yellow and white If it s not the base case then it selects a random point i j inside the current rectangle and then calls piet 4 more times passing in the various coordinates that form the 4 new interior rectangles This divide and conquer approach of having a function that calls itself is the hallmark of recursion Simple recursive processes are often used to create natural looking objects For example we can create a natural looking plant using the following simple recursive process where each plant begins as a straight line This line is replaced with a new branch that consists of the original line plus 3 4 new alternating branches The exact number of branches is determined by a variable you can set This same process is applied recursively for each new branch up to a depth you specify The following figure illustrates the basic idea Lines are represented as vectors A vector consists of an origin point defined by the variables x and y a length defined by the variable r and an angle defined by the variable theta The following figure shows how these variables are related This figure illustrates a few of the simple plants created with this basic process Here s the sketch plant pde Finally I d be remiss without showing the Snowflake curve one of the best known recursive figures The base case is a simple triangle Each edge is then replaced by a new set of 4 line segments that are 1 3 the length of the original line You then repeatedly replace each of these new segments with a new 4 line segment this recursive step The following figure should give you the basic idea of the process The results look like this Here s the sketch snowflake pde Note that you ll need to have the controlP5 contributed library to change the recursive depth often referred to as N to see how it affects the image Unfortunately I had to limit the maximum recursive depth to 6 rather than infinity since the library does not currently support slidebars that extend beyond your monitor screen and into the far reaches of the known universe More Check out all of the Codebox columns In the Maker Shed Getting

shows certain foods suddenly become healthier when eaten in combination From spinach and beets to red wine and apples here are 10 pairings that boost each other s benefits Why does orange juice taste so good with oatmeal And what is it about olive oil that enhances the flavor of tomatoes The answers to these questions it turns out are buried deep within our instincts New evidence suggests that certain foods that taste great together also interact with one another in nutritionally positive ways In other words two particular foods consumed in combination can actually deliver more benefits than either one would on its own Epidemiologist David R Jacobs refers to this phenomenon as food synergy He believes that it might explain why we are inherently crave certain foods together as well as how they join forces to protect and nourish our bodies Here are 10 food combos that maximize absorption of the good elements while keeping the bad ones out of your system 1 Spinach Beets Popeye has been selling us on the power of spinach for 80 years but he should skip the canned variety and if he really wants to do himself some good throw in some beets According to dietitian Joanne Larsen dark green leafy vegetables like spinach and kale are best eaten in combination with another veggie high in Vitamin C like beets because iron absorption in your intestines is improved by Vitamin C Tomatoes and bell peppers are also great sources of the immuno boosting vitamin for those who don t like having pink stained hands Try serving Roasted Beet Salad over a bed of baby spinach 2 Tomatoes Olive Oil Greeks consume more of these two ingredients per capita than anyone else and they have higher life expectancies than Americans Tomatoes are rich in an antioxidant called lycopene which has been proven to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease and certain cancers But lycopene is also fat soluble which means combining it with a healthy monounsaturated fat like olive oil helps boost absorption even more Technique Saut\u00e9ed tomatoes olive oil salt and pepper make a great fresh pasta sauce but you can also whip up a quick Caprese salad by adding some mozzarella and basil to sliced tomatoes drizzled with olive oil 3 Beef Carrots When you re in the mood for a hearty meal try this mix that will boost your immune function The Vitamin A in the carrots is best absorbed when bound to a protein Plus the beef delivers an extra dose of zinc which protects against weakening of the immune system Chef Gavin Kaysen s Braised Short Ribs combine both to make a savory supper 4 Green Tea Lemon Green tea is a true liquid miracle worker it s packed with antioxidants revs up metabolism and keeps you hydrated When drunk with lemon its benefits become turbocharged your body absorbs 13 times as many more antioxidants than when consumed on its own 5 Garlic Fish These two flavors were made for each other and when combined the cholesterol reducing fish oils and heart healthy garlic can act as an anti inflammatory agent Although the possibilities are endless it s hard to beat Chef Leah Cohen s Pan Seared Trout with Market Vegetables 6 Red Meats Rosemary While red meats shouldn t generally be seen as health foods we re all going to order the steak once in a while But you can mitigate the damage in a way that only adds to the taste The antioxidants rosmarinic acid and carnosic acid both found in rosemary can soak up and neutralize the meat s free radicals which are one of the key causes of signs of aging Try the Italian favorite Ragu d Ugnello for a meal that lets you indulge your carnivorous impulses without causing wrinkles 7 Orange Juice Oatmeal This is the real breakfast of champions The combination of these morning basics has actually been shown to prevent heart attacks and clean arteries twice as effectively as ingesting either one on its own The organic compounds known as phenols found in both stabilize cholesterol levels when consumed together Tip Instant oatmeal is often processed with added sugars salt and colorings so go for old fashioned rolled oats Homemade Oatmeal Peanut Butter Energizers will get you out of bed 8 Apples Red Wine With all the recent studies proclaiming the health benefits of red wine you might be tempted to swap your apple a day for a glass of Pinot now you have an excuse to enjoy both Apples contain an anti inflammatory flavonoid called quercetin while red wine contains the flavonoid catechin Together they work to prevent blood clots and improve cardiovascular functioning Try 5 Star Sangria for a healthy bit of boozing 9 Blueberries Grapes Both of these antioxidant packed fruits are great for on the go snacking or for adding to yogurt But it s also been proven that fruits mixed together actually have a greater antioxidant response than one fruit eaten on its own Trick Buy blueberries and grapes when they re in season freeze them in a single layer on a baking sheet then store them in bags for year round use Break out the blender and try them in this Blueberry Grape Smoothie 10 Nuts Seeds Dried Fruit Trail mix anyone Nutritionist Lauren Talbot says that nuts and seeds are high in protein and contain little water as do dried fruits and that eating these dense foods together makes for easier digestion Toss together some Crunchy Trail Mix for a nutritious snack research shows certain foods

in 2010 he did so against a backdrop of uncertainty Its arrival came with the typical predictable fanfare Apple devotees queued around the block to get their hands on it while technology blogs and news websites including this one prodded excitedly at it Is this the future of computing everyone wondered Back then nobody really knew the answer It was a mood best summed up by a simple remark from BBC website reader Ian Mears I must admit I want one he wrote But I don t know what I d actually do with it Yet the numbers do not lie Two years and over 50 million units later Apple can rightly claim to be king of the tablet market But as Apple chief executive Tim Cook launched the new iPad he did so facing a different kind of uncertainty Less cool Today s doubts centre on whether the Apple s device can remain at the top of the tablet tree Judging by the reaction of the technology watchers at the London media event Apple has done just enough for now I think they ve done a good job to give first generation iPad owners a reason to upgrade says Carolina Milanesi lead Apple analyst for Gartner And also to all the people who felt a little less cool now than they did an hour and a half ago That s what Apple does Aside from the unsurprising addition of the retina high quality display of particular interest was the addition of 4G LTE technology a method of receiving data far faster than the iPad s existing 3G capabilities But for buyers in the UK this speed boost remains out of reach The country s telecoms regulator Ofcom is still planning a 4G mobile spectrum auction By the time the networks roll out next year the next iPad may have been unveiled Despite the frustrations this may cause to some UK owners Ms Milanesi predicts that it will not prove too damaging to sales If it was at a higher price people might have said why bother she says Most people will still use their own wi fi and although we re not going to see LTE they have optimised HSDPA an enhanced 3G protocol So even to a UK consumer it should see some improvement Slamming Samsung At present most of the iPad s competitors come in the form of Google Android powered devices mainly from Samsung and Motorola Mr Cook attempted to deal with this head on with a cockiness designed to delight the Apple watchers in attendance while also antagonising the creators and perhaps the owners of the Samsung Galaxy Tab Reeling through apps such as Twitter on the Samsung device Mr Cook claimed to have demonstrated the inferiority of his rival It is no coincidence some would say that this show of bravado comes at a time when Apple and Samsung remain locked in ongoing patent legal battles Nevertheless even one of Samsung s product strategy managers recently admitted honestly we re not doing very well in the tablet market according to a recent Cnet report Even so experts are keeping a close eye on the Galaxy Note which is sized somewhere between a tablet and a smartphone The firm has already shipped more than two million units While not all of those will equate to sales the figure is considerably better than some doubters predicted The South Korean firm is targeting 10 million shipments by the end of the year But turning back to tablets one company that may pose more of a challenge is Apple s long time rival Microsoft The firm enjoyed a high profile and well received launch for the preview of its Windows 8 operating system last week The system will offer users the same functionality on their PC and tablets Come Christmas time the big battle in the consumer space will be Microsoft versus Apple with Google pushed to the side predicts Stuart Miles of Pocket lint Gartner s Ms Milanesi agrees saying that the multi platform Windows 8 operating system will have Apple looking over its shoulder I do think that overall Microsoft is going to be a more serious contender than Android simply because I still don t understand what Google wants to achieve Their focus around revenue coming from advertising takes them away from caring about the device the experience and what comes with it Amazon s appeal However it may be too early to write Android s prospects off The operating system already accounts for nearly 50 of the US smartphone market according to a recent study by Comscore Time magazine and Wired have reported rumours that a Google branded seven inch tablet may launch later this year running the new Ice Cream Sandwich version of the software and undercutting the iPad in price offering the firm a fresh opportunity to appeal to owners of phones using its system Amazon s Kindle Fire appears to have proved that there is an appetite for a budget priced tablet The firm has not released detailed sales figures but analysts at iSuppli have estimated that it shipped 3 9 million devices in the US over the last quarter of 2011 accounting for a 14 3 share of the market If accurate that would make it the sector s second biggest player behind Apple Whether it will prove vulnerable to the discounted iPad 2 which remains on sale remains to be seen Blackberry s struggle The most exposed company may prove to be Canada s Research in Motion RIM The firm recently released version 2 0 of its Blackberry Playbook software providing fully functional email contacts and calendar apps that its tablet previously lacked It also offers users the opportunity to run Android software radically extending the amount of programs available But some analysts fear the company may still struggle to ignite interest and predict more bad news when it releases its next results on 29 March Apple may sell more of the new iPads in two days than RIM will have sold Playbooks over the whole of its fourth quarter says Colin Gillis senior technology analyst at BGC Partners in New York It s possible that the firm may have even had more returns than sales They lost the high end to Apple the low end is owned by Amazon and the enterprise market will soon be owned by Microsoft with Windows

miraculous home run Thursday night was filled with maddening errors and slapstick baseball That s what made it so good Reuters When a team defies odds so heavy that the outcome is taken for granted as it was by a Dallas Fox affiliate that texted subscribers last night to inform them that The Texas Rangers have won the World Series we call it magical There is no other word As Game Six of the 2011 World Series ended third baseman David Freese had his uniform torn off by rabid teammates struck with giddy disbelief That s how good it was For a St Louis Cardinals fan which I am Thursday night was like VE Day on a baseball diamond When I think of the game now the only thoughts I can conjure are of this photograph and sometimes Glenn Frey s The Heat Is On Imagine being told by a doctor that you have a life threatening illness And then that you don t And then that you do And then that you don t And then that you do And then that you don t The mind reels No one expected this dramatic ending especially after Freese dropped a routine fly ball in the fifth inning allowing Texas to begin a rally that would capture the lead It was the worst kind of error a Little League miscue Freese one handed the catch a bit nonchalantly closed his glove early and the ball glanced off It was bad I screamed obscenities The Cardinals were doomed it seemed to an offseason of Mexican league winter ball and unadulterated remorse But the hometown kid Freese graduated from Lafayette High School in an exurb of St Louis made good improbably lifting a game winning 11th inning home run off Rangers pitcher Mark Lowe to extend this Series to Game Seven in St Louis Friday night Freese s turn from goat to hero signified something bigger about Game Six It was the best of games but it was also the worst of games an error fest in which both teams tried excrutiatingly hard to lose For half of the game all the dramatic twists and turns came on miscues Top of the 4th game tied 2 2 It s already been a tense back and forth affair Rangers outfielder Nelson Cruz hits a routine pop up to left field and Cardinals outfielder Matt Holliday somehow against all logic and sense neglects to call for it The play ends with Holliday yelling frantically over shortstop Rafael Furcal the ball plopping sadly on the outfield grass and Holliday crawling pathetically toward it on his knees It is the second time in his Cardinals career that Holliday has dropped a routine fly ball in postseason play The first happened against Los Angeles in 2009 Cruz scores later in the inning Top of the 4th Rangers lead 3 2 Cardinals pitcher Fernando Salas throws a changeup to Rangers pitcher Colby Lewis who bunts it back to him Salas attempts a force out at second base but air mails his throw into the outfield Bottom of the 4th Rangers lead 3 2 Lance Berkman hits a sharp grounder Rangers first baseman Michael Young has trouble getting it out of his glove He throws it to Lewis who misses first base with his foot Berkman later scores on a ground out Top of the 5th Game tied 3 3 Just as the game seems to have reached an equilibrium the Freese error happens Josh Hamilton who reached base scores on a double in the next at bat giving Texas the lead Cardinals fans everywhere scream obscenities Bottom of the 6th Rangers lead 4 3 The game has become truly ugly Holliday hits a grounder to Rangers first baseman Young who bobbles it literally tossing it into the air out of his glove as if he s about to begin a juggling act and attempts a diving tag near first base He misses Lance Berkman advances to third base on the play and later scores Bottom of the 6th Game tied 4 4 Holliday is picked off at third base diving wrist first into Adrian Beltre s foot and seeming to injure himself on the play He screams at the umpire The Cardinals leave the bases loaded and fail to take the lead All of this made Game Six a rolling heart attack for fans This is not World Series baseball a friend remarked during the middle innings I agreed For the Cardinals the tragicomedy of Game Six mirrored the team s entire season When ace pitcher Adam Wainwright tore an elbow ligament in spring training St Louis wasn t supposed to do much of anything this season But somehow the team came on strong in the early part of the year and by the grace of the National League Central s relatively soft competition the Cardinals remained competitive until the Milwaukee Brewers finally ran away with it The Cardinals fell apart in August a summer slump precipitated largely by fielding errors They were done 10 5 games behind the Atlanta Braves in a non race for the wild card on Aug 27 But the Braves collapsed handing the Cardinals a chance and the NL champs seized it completing an impossible streak to the postseason Watching Thursday night s game I thought more than once Well they weren t even supposed to get here The Cardinals proved miraculously that it is possible to win a World Series game by dropping routine fly balls They also proved that slapstick error riddled baseball can become exciting in the end and that the errors can actually become the excitement In the 5th inning Freese was the biggest goat of this year s World Series Had the Cardinals lost on Thursday night he could be called one of the biggest goats in St Louis World Series history But Game Six was so dramatic partly because Freese turned it around He had to be down before he was up otherwise the action wouldn t have had the same significance It wouldn t have been the same without all those maddening horrific bungles It s easy to remember that David Freese won Game Six with an improbable home run to center field It s slightly more difficult to remember that he tied the game before that with a triple But it s important to remember the awful moment that came before When Fox grabbed Freese for a postgame interview to ask him the all time obvious question of how it feels to hit a game winning home run in a World Series in one s hometown the first words out of his mouth were I m just glad I had a chance after looking like an idiot on that popup Freese briefly quit baseball when he was young burned out In 2009 the Cardinals almost gave up on him as their third baseman in waiting after a DUI arrest which followed a 2008 public intoxication charge Freese almost didn t become the hometown hero he is today But he did Game Six took its time to mature Without all that error driven back and forth the greatest game in World Series history wouldn t have happened Image credit Jeff Haynes Reuters before david

pie top crust pie shepherd s pie fish pie pie with mash with chips with gravy Steak and kidney chicken and mushroom Pie pie pie I love pie But then who doesn t love that most comforting of winter dishes The word alone is enough to warm the heart and conjure visions of knives piercing crusty lids releasing clouds of stream from piping hot fillings of tender meat soft vegetables and rich creamy sauce Hungry yet Apparently you are because Britain is going pie crazy Sales of pastry and potato topped dishes are higher than they have been since the Seventies with supermarkets and smaller purveyors of pies reporting sales of an extra 17m pies over the past two years according to Nielsen a market research firm The pie market is now worth 229m up 16 per cent since 2008 as shoppers with shallow pockets stock up on deep fillings to consume at home But despite a push in supermarkets towards the gourmet end of pie territory for every tender asparagus tips and Portobello mushrooms in a creamy mushroom and herb sauce pie Waitrose 1 78 there s an anaemic football ground pasty waiting to turn your stomach The only way to guarantee a good pie Make it yourself I ve come to the Baker Street branch of Canteen a group of four London restaurants that knock out some of the capital s finest affordable British fare including I m hoping some exceedingly good pies Cass Titcombe is the man in charge in the vast kitchen where stock simmers in giant pans and cooks do prep for the evening service In 2005 the softly spoken chef with a passion for British cuisine spotted a gap in the market for quick keenly priced traditional food served in a modern setting Think a slightly more modern Pizza Express but with devilled kidneys on toast potted duck and treacle tart The first branch of Canteen in east London s trendy Spitalfields Market was a hit with critics and locals quickly spawning three more outlets in the capital They come for the daily roast the fish and chips the sausage and mash and the pies Each day brings two specials one meat one vegetable from a list of a dozen or so pastry topped delicacies that Titcombe devises every 18 months They include classics such as steak and kidney alongside fillings like pork cider and mustard Pies are easy Titcombe assures me People get put off by the pastry but it s really not hard to make a shortcrust pastry But first the filling We re going for a roast chicken and leek number one of Canteen s most popular pies Titcombe has already roasted a chicken so all that s left to do is to fry up and combine the ingredients The pastry rolling is just as straightforward although when I attempt to create the pie s lid it takes on a distinctly Australian shape compared to Titcombe s perfect oval But it s good enough and the pie crimped pierced and brushed with egg is thrown into the oven So what is it about pies that gets us drooling Sophie Conran ought to know The daughter of restaurant emperor Sir Terence Conran she s the author of Sophie Conran s Pies a book of recipes published in 2006 She used to run a small business supplying posh pies to food halls in Harrods and Harvey Nichols To me pies represent the warmth of a family get together she says When you take a pie out of the oven it looks a bit like a present the culinary equivalent of a hug You can prepare them in advance they re fun to make inexpensive and if you use the best ingredients you can find completely delicious Every spring Conran sits on the panel at the British Pie Awards hosted in May at the home of the pork pie Melton Mowbray in Leicestershire Butchers and bakers large and small and from every corner of Britain descend on St Mary s Church there to tempt judges with their steak and kidney pies fish pies apple pies pasties and football ground pies to name just some of the categories in the world s tastiest pie off Last year I had to taste 46 savoury pies Conran says We look for pastry texture sogginess amount of fill and overall taste The overall standard is very high If only all pies were as good I remember having bad pies at school recalls Titcombe who s poised to crack open the oven door And you still see poor excuses filled with too much junk designed to bulk them out Then you get restaurants pubs usually where chefs cook a bit of pastry separately slap it on a casserole and call it a pie That s not a pie Titcombe also warns against a growing trend for over adventurous fillings A few years ago I did some consultancy work for a few different pie companies Separately two of them gave me the same brief to create outlandish recipes One company wanted a Thai chicken pie and a Moroccan lamb pie like a tagine in pastry I did it because it was work but I did think it was going a bit far Ping Pie s ready Titcombe retrieves it from the oven and brings it out to the dining room where it s joined by two he made earlier a celeriac bacon and cheddar and a chard broccoli and roast onion see recipes below He cuts first into our chicken pie slicing through the beautifully browned pastry crust and scooping out its juicy filling The smell which carries a hint of the mustard s sharpness is amazing And needless to say it is delicious After the feast before I waddle towards the door I ask Titcombe if he knows anyone who doesn t love pie Yeah my son Oscar he replies He s 10 and won t eat pastry Give him a sausage roll and he ll eat the sausage and throw away the rest Oscar you don t know what you re missing To top it all Pie recipes Shortcrust pastry This recipe is enough to top and bottom line a

seasoned drinker or someone who just turned 21 beer is generally the most diverse cheapest and best drink to enjoy year round With there being so many types of beers out there it can sometimes be hard to choose If you re thinking about throwing a party or bringing a cooler to a tailgating party you can use this reference list of 5 Types of Beer to create an awesome cooler If we ve missed any of your favorite types of beers be sure to add them in the comments below 1 Ales The beauty about Ales is that of all the types of beers on our list Ales have been around for the longest People in 15th century England were sitting around enjoying Ales So what is it about Ales that make them so good Well when the Ale is brewed it doesn t convert as much sugars into alcohol What does that do to the beer Well it gives it a sweeter and fruitier taste What does an Ale go well with Pretty much everything our beer experts agree that Ales are an excellent type of beer for any occasion whether you re grilling up steaks or enjoying a tray of Nachos Editors pick Try an IPA when I was a young beer drinker I thought that IPA was a different type of beer but really IPA s are an ale IPA means Indian Pale Ale IPA s still retain the sweet fruity flavor of Ales as well as an added Hops flavor Others to try Redhook ESB Widmer Hefewiezen Pyramid Snow Cap Redhook Chinook Alaskan Summer Ale 2 Lagers Whether or not you know it you ve probably drank a type of beer Lager at some time Lagers make up most of the mass produced American Labels like Budweiser and Coors Most Lagers have a significant amount of carbonation and a crisp taste Lagers generally range from very light to very dark depending on the brewer and what type of an environment they re brewed in A good microbrew lager not a domestic lager is an excellent way to introduce yourself into the world of gourmet beers What does a Lager go well with Lagers go excellent with Spicy Foods Mexican food Indian food and pizzas Editors Pick Your local Microbrew While this may be seen as a cop out answer by far the best Lager is going to be the local microbrew in your area Living in San Francisco I ve found some excellent microbrew lagers So just be adventurous Others to try Creemore Springs Premium Lager St Nicholaus Bock Bier Yebisu Black Beer Haffenreffer Private Stock Black Bavarian 3 Porters While Porters are a very strong and delicious type of beer in recent centuries their popularity has pretty much sunk They originated in England in the 1700s and were a favorite by men who worked as porters hence their names As the centuries trudged on porters became less and less popular while ales and lagers started to proliferate in the market But then in the 1970s and the 1980s due to the rise of home micro brewing Porters started to make a come back So why should you go out and pick up a porter Well Porters are dark strong and have a bitter hops flavor infused with a hint of chocolate What does a Porter go well with Porters go well with any meat dish beef chicken lamb pork etc They also go excellently with desserts Editors Pick Hands Down it s the Sierra Nevada Porter This is an excellent porter with a strong taste a delicious malty flavor to it and it s not too heavy or strong Others to try Black Butte XX Black Earth Porter Smuttynose Robust Porter Devil Over A Barrel Bourbon Barrel Aged Coffee Imperial Oatmeal Porter Alaskan Smoked Porter 4 Stouts It s hard to imagine a top 5 Types of Beer list without putting a stout on it Stouts origin is quite muddled but it can t be argued that Stouts are essentially the beer of my homeland Ireland Stouts are a very dark full bodied type of beer they re very thick and can have a flavor very similar to coffee but they can also take on many other flavors including sweet bitter milk and even oatmeal What does a Stout go well with Stouts are generally a meal in and of themselves They are so thick and strong it s hard to imagine eating anything for a while after enjoying your first stout Though it should be noted for the brave that a stout goes excellent with a gourmet hamburger Editors Pick Every Stout Stouts much like snowflakes are going to be completely different not only from distributor to distributor but just from production day to production day Don t believe me Go to your favorite Irish Bar and order a Guinness make sure it s from the tap Then go back the next day and ask them if they ve switched out the keg from last night and order a Guinness again Notice the subtle differences from yesterday s beer and today s beer So if you ve had a Bad Experience with a stout in the past go to your local bar and try a stout again I can almost guarantee that you ll enjoy the stout today Others to try Oyster Stout Samual Smith s Double Chocolate Stout Guinness Alesmith Speedway Stout Russian Imperial 5 Pilsner Pilsners originated from a town that is now part of the Czech Republic The beer has a Golden color they are clear and sparkly Pilsners have a very strong hoppy full flavor generally more overpowering than your standard lagers Pilsners are soft and easy to drink because Pilsners don t have a thick body What does a Pilsner go with Pilsners are best enjoyed with meats excluding beef Pilsners go well with mild cheese as well Lamb burgers anyone Editors Pick While Pilsners are not my favorite type of beers my friends swear by Pilsner Urquell Bohemian Pilsner If you can t find this type of beer in your local grocery store Liquor stop try out one of the other assortments of Pilsners out there If you can t find one just grab another case of Guinness Others to try Flensburger Brauerei s Bitburger Wernesgr\u00fcner F\u00fcrstenberg Schwelmer Pils Hopefully this article has been helpful for you There s an entire world of beers out there depending on where you go or where you live you can create a list of your personal favorite beers This can also be used as a crib sheet for your next party Instead of buying 3 cases of Budweiser or PBR try picking up a couple different types of beers off this list and casually explain to your party goers how diverse a Stout s flavors can be If we ve missed any of

fresh natural ingredients and Paul is there to ensure that the very first chocolate produced in Soho uses the exact same techniques and tastes just as spectacular as the very first chocolate to be sold at Camden Passage five years ago Impressively this passion and commitment to craftsmanship extends beyond the products and into the stores themselves At the new Soho store everything from the central display table down to the refrigeration units has been reclaimed recycled up cycled locally sourced or handmade This includes a wonderfully unique glass chandelier at the centre of the store and a beautiful reclaimed wooden alter that now serves as the main counter I can t think of a better use Downstairs we were given a tour of the fantastic kitchen space the new store provides which stretches out underneath the shop above as well as the two adjacent stores Unused when they found it the basement once housed an old Soho nightclub and given Paul s description of crumbling arches nicotine soaked walls and seriously dodgy electrics it s a wonder how the team managed in only six weeks to transform it into the gleaming white kitchen there now As Paul spoke you could see and hear his excitement at the opportunities this space would provide In recent years Soho has seen a resurgence as a food hot spot with top restaurants caf\u00e9s and boutique delicatessens springing up but this is the first artisan chocolaterie in the area It is this younger more adventurous food scene that Paul and his team are hoping to tap into with the new flagship store putting the huge kitchen space to use on innovation creating and launching new seasonal product lines with a shorter time span It is this creativity innovation and fearless use of unusual flavours that really makes Paul A Young chocolates stand out We were given a chance to try the new summer range that includes such unexpected flavours as tomato basil and olive oil orange and tarragon St Germain liqueur with elderflower and wild strawberry balsamic and black pepper alongside his known classics like the Marmite truffle Through some quirk or foolishness on my part I d previously only tried Paul s chocolate once at an Easter Egg tasting where his sea salted caramel egg outstripped everything else we tasted So when faced with a chance to try the entire current range well I went a bit mad Despite an initial show of reserve I ended up losing all restraint trying one of near to all the chocolates there that s somewhere in the region of 20 chocolates or more That my friends is too much chocolate and trust me there can be such a thing Amidst my gluttonous binge though and before the eventual sugar shakes set in there were several flavours that really shone From the summer range the sea salted black sesame tahini just worked perfectly as did the passion fruit curd and coffee the fruitiness of which was so well balanced I was amazed I d never seen the two paired before A returning chocolate but new to me the goats cheese rosemary and lemon was divine but my absolute favourite was the Kernel Brewery stout and dark muscovado Honestly it may make me a failure as a writer but words simply could not express how incredible that chocolate was a deeply contented moan might just about capture it In the hands of any other chocolatier whacky flavour combinations like those above might end up tasting gimmicky or odd but not here This is the reason Paul is held in such high regard as a craftsman as well as an innovator for every chocolate I tried the individual flavours were distinct and vibrant yet married seamlessly each giving way to another as you ate On top of the single chocolate the store also produces rotating collections of artisan chocolate bars flavoured bars and brownies We were given a brownie to try at home all I can say is this is what every brownie wishes it could taste like but never knew how deep dark rich and incredibly squidgy www paulayoung co uk Paul A

ness Cognitive brain fit ness Both require nov elty vari ety and chal lenge Pro fes sor Schlomo Breznitz a sci en tific and busi ness leader in the cog ni tive fit ness field explains why elo quently below Per haps we want change really means we need change Enjoy Why are every day life chal lenges not suf fi cient to keep our brains fit By Prof Shlomo Breznitz Often when describ ing the ben e fits of Mind Fit to brain health I am asked by peo ple in the audi ence whether this soft ware is really needed After all so they argue life pro vides con tin ues cog ni tive chal lenges which should suf fice for ensur ing brain fit ness From the moment we wake up until we go to sleep our brains have to attend to com plex stim uli plan many activ i ties some of them quite com plex and carry us through what ever the day offers These tasks should pro vide suf fi cient brain exer cise with out the need to engage in spe cific men tal workout This line of argu ment sounds oddly famil iar since it is an exact dupli ca tion of claims made in the recent past against the need for phys i cal exer cise One jumps into the car and from the car and per haps even climbs a few stairs before sit ting in the chair which should be enough to burn the calo ries and keep fit It took us a few long years to real ize that the move ments called for by ordi nary every day life tasks are far from suf fi cient to keep us phys i cally fit and unless we engage in delib er ate work out we are bound to gain weight and suf fer the con se quences The bal ance sheet in this case is quite sim ple even a super fi cial com par i son to the activ i ties of peo ple with less seden tary lifestyles indi cates that we are not mov ing enough By con trast to our fore fa thers who lived as hunters gatherers and this is the most valid com par i son since we are phys i cally the same we are prac ti cally immo bi lized by comforts Like in the case of phys i cal fit ness cog ni tive fit ness requires delib er ate exer cis ing The main rea son for this rests on the fact that our brains are basi cally lazy There are in prin ci ple two very dif fer ent modes of activ ity that our brains engage in when ever faced with a problem a Analy sis of the sit u a tion and of the pos si ble alter na tive actions and their con se quences This mode requires sig nif i cant resources of atten tion takes time and is men tally effortful b Alter na tively we can search for sim i lar expe ri ences in the past and evoke a sim i lar solu tion This mode does not require atten tion is very fast and auto matic Fur ther more search ing one s data base for prior expe ri ence is easy and there is lit tle or no men tal effort involved It should come as no sur prise there fore that the brain prefers by far the auto matic mode to the effort ful one when ever pos si ble This has many obvi ous advan tages as well as some dis ad van tages Chief among them is the dan ger that the degree of sim i lar ity between past expe ri ence and the present prob lem would be sac ri ficed for rea sons of con ve nience This can lead to neglect of impor tant sit u a tional fea tures that ren der the old famil iar solu tion inadequate This pref er ence and reliance on expe ri en tial prece dents feeds directly into our ten dency to develop rou tines After doing some thing a few times the activ ity any activ ity becomes grad u ally a rou tine one requir ing less atten tion and less effort There are many things we do well pre cisely due to their becom ing increas ingly more auto matic in terms of the cog ni tive work involved Dri ving is a par tic u larly famil iar exam ple Safe dri ving requires on the aver age two years of dri ving expe ri ence dur ing which time the brain devel ops help ful rou tines to deal with famil iar chal lenges on the road How ever the ten dency to develop rou tines is by no means rel e vant exclu sively to motor activities Thus word recog ni tion in read ing becomes auto matic and allows us to attend to mean ing rather than the process of decod ing each word from its con stituent let ters and syl la bles As we gain expe ri ence even highly com plex intel lec tual activ i ties become rou tine over time Rou tines make things eas ier but for that same rea son they become less chal leng ing Thus as we go about the tasks of liv ing we become more expe ri enced and those very tasks lose their abil ity to chal lenge our brains More over old peo ple have too much expe ri ence They have seen almost every thing heard almost every thing and faced most sit u a tions in the past It is for this rea son that every day life expe ri ences can not ensure brain fit ness any more than they can assure phys i cal fit ness The anal ogy does not stop here and just as we need phys i cal work out we need cog ni tive work outs as well The above analy sis points to activ i ties hold ing the great est promise of healthy chal lenge to the brain Namely they have to be novel Read ing a new book vis it ing new places try ing new foods learn ing to play a musi cal instru ment or best learn ing a new lan guage these are the activ i ties that brain fit ness is made of And on top of it engage in qual ity cog ni

be when we re still technically having summery weather albeit that the mornings are now cold and we even had frost a couple of mornings ago I m going to stomp my feet and throw a tantrum I m not a winter person at all and autumn might as well be winter in the UK In fact I m one of those people that finds myself a bit chilly even when it s 25 77 and wearing a light jacket when everyone else is wearing summer tanks I m so ready ready to bid farewell to all the summer berries and ice creams I ve been perving at the last few months Therefore today I m rebelling with lime cheesecake bars Not that it s all that rebellious The modern world brings us imported limes even during the winter months but hey it s the thought that counts I ve adapted this recipe to make it easier and less time consuming to make thanks to ready made lime curd but the recipe for lime curd is included below if you wish to make from scratch I did make the lime curd to go with this cheesecake but my thermometer decided to die on me just before the part where I needed it It was working up until that point then BAM So I had to guess but I ll be using that lime curd for something else Dudes and dudettes you have to make some of these bad boys They re the yummiest cheesecake bars or cheesecake I ve ever tasted I could not stop eating the raw batter whilst making these key lime cheesecake bars I m surprised there was even enough filling to go into them The giant man baby made the following official statement You re good at making cheesecakes now aren t you Not sure whether to take that as a

Expect the mixture to look curdled this is normal Cook the mixture over a medium heat in a medium sized saucepan until it looks smooth and no longer curdled Increase the heat slightly and cook whisking constantly until the mixture thickens Using a thermometer cook until the mixture reaches 170 77 Remove the curd from the heat and transfer into a bowl Press plastic wrap in the surface of the lime curd to keep a skin from forming Chill the lime curd in a refrigerator the curd will thicken more as it cools It will keep in the fridge for approx 2 weeks FOR THE CRUST Preheat the oven to 325 175 line a 10 10 inch pan with parchment that overhangs the edges Mix the butter and graham crackers or digestive biscuits together and press into the bottom of the pan evenly Bake the crust for 5 minutes and allow to cool completely FOR THE CRUST Tint \u00be of a cup of the lime curd with the green and yellow food colouring until a lime rind green and set aside Beat cream cheese and sugar in a

nearing make or break time Sponsored by energy drink Red Bull Austrian extreme athlete Felix Baumgartner 41 plans to skydive from a balloon in the stratosphere at an altitude of 120 000 feet 36 576 meters If he can do it he ll become the first person to break the sound barrier outside of an aircraft He ll also break a trio of other records that have stood for more than 50 years Baumgartner s plunge would mark the highest skydive the highest manned balloon flight and the longest free fall at about 5 minutes and 30 seconds The quest called Red Bull Stratos recently got back on track after being stalled by a legal challenge claiming that the idea of the dive was earlier suggested to Red Bull by California promoter Daniel Hogan That suit has now been settled out of court and the Red Bull Stratos project is moving forward google ads i line2 google ads i line3 s if google ads 0 bidtype CPC google adnum google adnum google ads length document write s return google ad client pub

according to the Daily Mail Jumping for science While the dive will certainly offer an adrenaline rush and major bragging rights Baumgartner says he s jumping for science too The team will study Baumgartner s physical condition and the effects of such a dive on the human body in an effort to better understand how people can survive in space Photos Training for Red Bull s Supersonic Space Jump This mission is all about pioneer work Baumgartner said in a statement released Tuesday Feb 7 Maybe one day people will look back and say it was Felix Baumgartner and the Red Bull Stratos team that helped to develop the suit that they re wearing in space We want to do something for posterity The Red Bull Stratos team also includes aerospace engineers who are custom designing cutting edge technology for the jump We ll be setting new standards for aviation said Red Bull Stratos medical director Jonathan Clark a former space shuttle crew surgeon Never before has anyone gone supersonic without being in an aircraft Red Bull Stratos is testing new equipment and developing the procedures for inhabiting such high altitudes as well as enduring such extreme acceleration The aim is to improve the safety for space professionals as well as potential space tourists Air Force Captain Joseph Kittinger Jr jumps from Excelsior III balloon gondola in 1960 test freefalling toward Earth for over 4 minutes Risky mission To make the dive Baumgartner will ascend higher than four times the height of Mount Everest inside a custom made pressurized capsule pulled up by a single helium filled plastic balloon about 600 feet 182 meters wide Roughly 35 seconds after he jumps out Baumgartner will reach supersonic speeds and will continue freefalling until he is about a mile above the ground when he will deploy his parachute The risks involved are multifold At such lofty altitudes Baumgartner will need a special pressure suit to insulate him against the thin air freezing temperatures and low pressures He must also resist falling into an uncontrolled spin which could render him unconscious The team tried out some of the equipment and procedures Baumgartner plans to use during his jump in a recent test inside a vacuum chamber at Brooks City Base in Texas This test was enormously important for our self confidence The success has given us an additional boost to rise to the challenges that still lie ahead Baumgartner said The team plans to conduct the first manned test flights at altitude soon Daredevil skydiver Felix Baumgartner is planning to make a record breaking supersonic jump from the edge of space CREDIT Red Bull Stratos Breaking records Baumgartner previously became the first person to cross the English Channel in freefall in 2003 He s also made record breaking parachute jumps from some of the world s tallest structures including the World Financial Center T101 in Taipei Taiwan and the statue of Christ the Redeemer in Rio de Janeiro Brazil He is now attempting to break records set in 1960 by U S Air Force Captain Joe Kittinger who leaped from a balloon at an altitude of about 102 800 feet 31 333 meters Since then others have tried and failed to beat his performance New Jersey native Nick Piantanida died trying to set a new record in 1966 Now Kittinger is part of the Red Bull Stratos team advising Baumgartner This article was provided by

butter to Vietnamese saffron foodies have turned the act of tasting the world s best food into a competitive sport Meanwhile back in your own pantry you re lucky to find so much as a can of beans But even if your own budget won t support such refined ingredients you too can be a frugal foodie Here are some simple items that can turn your everyday grocery list into something resembling a 4 star menu for fewer than 4 bucks 1 Off Brand Orange Marmalade 2 3Why spend the money on high end read expensive orange marmalade if you re just using it as a glaze for meat or adding it into a dessert To get the flavor benefit without the added cost try adding orange marmalade to an oozing round of soft cheese that has been warmed in the oven and then top it off with candied walnuts or toasted pine nuts Serve with crackers Also mix with an equal part of mustard and rub on salmon pork or chicken 2 Fresh Dill 2 2 50Some people think that being able to draw from a collection of herbs and spices is the secret to great cooking That may be but quality not quantity is the key to sealing your foodie cred Those herbs that are browning away on your spice rack aren t doing anything for a dish s flavor profile The trick to making effective use of any herbs is freshness and dill can add a delicious subtle touch to all sorts of dishes Try mixing it with plain cream cheese and spread on crackers or bagel chips topped with smoked salmon diced tomatoes and red onions 3 Asian Chili Paste 3 59There s nothing quite like the fiery high note of chili paste to give a dish depth and make it more interesting Look for it in the market with the name Sambal Oelek Sambal Oelek is unique as a flavoring ingredient because it is typically made up only of chilies with no other additives Add lime and sugar and you ve got sweet Indonesian dipping sauce Add to mayo for an Asian aioli which makes a fab spread on toasted bread with any sandwich filling Or serve alongside Gyoza Japanese noodle dumplings 4 Whole Grain Mustard 4 50Move beyond the French s and explore some more exotic mustard varieties While there are a variety of mustards from sweet honey to Chinese to Dijon available to you Maille has a flavor and texture that adds interest to everything from sausage to deli sandwiches to salad dressings and sauces And you only need a little Make your own salad dressing A dab of mustard some red wine vinegar olive oil and a bit of honey can dress up even the most garden variety salad Add herbs for variation 5 Fresh Ginger Root 1 50Ginger always seems to get overlooked in favor of its admittedly amazing cousin garlic But that s a shame Ginger has depth round edges and an almost citric bite that as Asian cooks have long known goes great with fresh and cheap ingredients Make a ginger dressing by combining ginger with sesame oil and rice vinegar and either mix by hand or in a blender Add your dressing to a coleslaw mix to make an Asian slaw Or serve it alongside Ahi Tuna Tartar for the kind of appetizer found in many high end restaurants no cooking required 6 Risotto 4It sounds fancy but Risotto takes less than 20 minutes to make and can be a great way to use up leftover vegetables cheese or even seafood or sausage Just add about 1 4 cup of whatever topping you like to each serving right before putting it on the plate Classic combos include mushrooms and Parmesan sausage and tomato or shrimp and peas 7 Greek Yogurt 2There s no reason to use plain yogurt when you can get the rich unsweetened Greek variety instead Use in dips cream sauces roll ups and desserts Combine with mint garlic and lemon to taste and serve alongside hummus pita and chopped veggies You might not think so but Greek Yogurt is also perfect for cooking Indian style yogurt chicken 8 Vinegar 1 1 50Vinegar is cheap but it can transform ordinary root vegetables into taste sensations Start with the cheapest carrots beets and onions you can find and make pickles by briefly boiling them then cooling in ice Add vinegar and sugar and you re done 9 Eggs 2 4Okay so even if you aren t much of a gourmet you ve probably got eggs on hand and if not you definitely should This staple is both versatile and still relatively inexpensive even if you go for the free range or organic variety But don t be confined to serving them sunny side up or scrambled Go gourmet by poaching them for an Eggs Benedict or Salad Lyonnaise eggs on a frisee salad with bacon Eggs can be added to casseroles used as the binding agent in veggie burgers or make their way into a frittata for a festive Sunday brunch For a quick frittata beat 4 or 5 eggs and then scramble slightly with spinach and mushrooms Bake in the pan in the oven until solid Once you ve got these ingredients stocked in your pantry look to sites like GourmetSleuth com EzEating net or SimplyRecipes for more great ideas on what to do with them from italian truffle butter to vietnamese saffron, foodies have turned the act of tasting the

thanksgiving for the novice thanksgiving for the novice"",""body"":""Turkey Tips We recommend fresh turkey for superior flavor and texture but frozen turkey is fine Make sure you leave enough time and room to thaw it in the refrigerator It takes about 24 hours for every 5 pounds that s at least 2 1 2 days for the 12 pounder used in this menu If you start to cut it close on time submerge the frozen turkey in cold water in the sink and change the water frequently It will take about 30 minutes per pound To prepare the turkey for roasting take it out of the plastic bag Remove the neck and giblets the heart liver and gizzard from the neck and body cavities Use the neck heart and gizzard for Homemade Turkey Stock Rinse the turkey thoroughly with cold water pat dry with paper towels If a metal clip secures the drumsticks you won t have to tie them with cotton kitchen twine The roasting rack is essential to keep the turkey from sticking to the bottom of the pan A relatively deep 2 to 3 inches roasting pan is also important so you can make gravy without splashing over the edge Disposable aluminum pans make terrible gravy and are so high sided they inhibit browning of the skin Plus they re flimsy and can be dangerous if overloaded with a heavy hot turkey The milk solids in the butter help brown the skin and the butter enhances the flavor of the drippings so it s better than vegetable oil for rubbing on the skin Cover the breast with foil during most of the roasting to protect lean meat from drying out The aluminum foil should be wrapped not tented around the entire breast This traps steam that rises during cooking and forces it back into the breast meat Remove the foil for the last hour or so of cooking to allow the skin to brown Many thermometers can check for doneness The disposable pop up thermometer that comes in most packaged turkeys works but basting can prevent it from popping up Perhaps the best option is a remote display thermometer with a probe to insert in the turkey It can alert you when the bird is done Because the monitor display sits on the counter you don t have to open the door to check the turkey s progress Get started with these six tips for a no fail first Thanksgiving 1 Make minitrips to avoid one huge exhausting shopping trip Create three shopping lists one for nonperishables that can be purchased well ahead such as beverages sugar flour camera film guest towels and soap and candles another for specific menu needs to buy a week or so ahead and to slip into everyday shopping such as the canned pumpkin and crystallized ginger for this menu and a final list for a couple of days before the holiday fresh produce the turkey and other perishables 2 Lists save the day Don t wait until the last minute to locate the gravy boat Make a list of serving bowls utensils and even cookware to be sure you have everything you need Also make a complete menu to hang in the kitchen so you don t forget to serve something 3 Helping hands sometimes need guidance Ask friends to contribute dishes but be prepared for problems if they don t bring what you expected Ask them to make a specific dish say broccoli not a side dish send the recipe with an explanation that this will help you keep the menu balanced Enlist noncooks to come early to help set the table and stay late to help with dishes 4 Watch for kitchen traffic jams Don t crowd the oven with lots of baked side dishes Choose some recipes to prepare on top of the stove for example our fresh tasting and colorful Broccoli and Carrots with Toasted Almonds as opposed to green bean casserole 5 Let the roast turkey stand before carving This is one of the great secrets of a holiday meal For maximum juiciness and flavor the turkey must stand at room temperature for at least 30 minutes to an hour This rest allows the juices to relax and helps the cook relax too Make the gravy first timers will need to concentrate on this job finish the side dishes and reheat make ahead dishes in the now empty oven while the turkey rests 6 Convenience foods will lessen your stress This is not the time to make your first piecrust or homemade dinner rolls On the other hand guests will appreciate homemade cranberry sauce and fresh bread stuffing which are easy ways to impress See more recipes and tips at Cooking Light More from Cooking Light Thanksgiving Wine and Beer

our ancestors did We want a fireplace to give architectural interest to a room to decorate above it with pictures and at Christmas to hang stockings from it I love collecting designs of fireplaces The ones here are what I call fun fireplaces Take a look and see why In her upstate New York home Marian McEvoy decorates her fireplace with the names of those who visit her I could kick myself now Our house had one of these fun vintage plug in log sets and I threw it out Who says you can t wall paper the inside of a fireplace Here drywall was wallpapered first before installation Check out the red

Claire Ideas Domino Elle Decor House Beautiful Living Etc Here s another lovely Atlanta wedding but instead of a wedding with red as was in a previous post this one is in pink It is a far less elaborate wedding but requires just as much attention to details forethought and planning Instead of a family estate the location is Atlanta s Ansley Park Instead of two tents only one is set up for the ceremony Without a second tent for the reception there is a risk with the weather but the location of the tables and chairs under the trees is worth the risk The chosen theme color is not a bright red as Nancy Braithwaite used but a softer tone of red a beautiful spring pink This color is used throughout the wedding Tables are covered in pink tablecloths with white overlays Buckets of flowers are wrapped in a favorite pink paper The touches of pink continue in the pink ribbon added to bamboo stakes lining the path to the tent A large pink peony is in the center of this beautiful garden

twice before you paint Pine paneling is making a stylish comeback Interior designer Steven Gambrel did this comfortable living room The clients felt the pine walls were part of the history of the house and wanted to keep them Steve they said was the only person who didn t say paint them white The couple love what he did So do I Who says paneling doesn t look cool with retro styled furniture Note the use of the narrow paneling on the walls and the use of wider paneling on the ceiling The two different scales create texture and movement This is a cozy paneled room from a cabin in northern California Instead of the Bonanza look think cowboy the owner has used an unexpected mix of furniture The modernist Carlo Mollino designed this dining room in his home on Lake Maggiore Italy The warmth of the wood with the green glazed tile is perfect together You didn t think paneling could look this good in a kitchen did you This pine paneling is wonderful in a traditional English inspired

toothpaste for bringing out the best in your pearly whites but did you know that toothpaste is useful for a wide variety of other purposes It s true Toothpaste can do much more than leave your smile bright and your breath minty fresh Take a look at these nine uses for toothpaste that will have you seeing your favorite brand in a whole new light 1 Treats Bee Stings and Insect Bites For this to work it must be an old fashioned paste toothpaste product rather than one of the new fangled gel toothpastes Wash the area in cold water to numb and draw out the pain Remove the stinger in the event of a bee sting Then dab toothpaste on the affected area Leave the toothpaste there do not rinse it off The longer it remains the better 2 Removes Crayon and other Marks from Painted Walls Believe it or not it s true Toothpaste the original paste variety is a miracle worker when it comes to getting rid of bothersome crayon marks left behind by little fingers The best part is that it won t remove the paint so it s safe to use on walls and other wood furniture that has been painted in a different color scheme than the offending crayon If you re cleaning on budget and need to remove crayon fast most dollar stores have tubes for one dollar or less This means you can even use this for an excellent and frugal crayon removal tip Hint Toothpaste should be safe for your paint and is in most cases However it is wise to do a small test area in an inconspicuous location on your wall before applying the toothpaste to a larger area in an effort to remove unsolicited works of art from your wall Let it sit for 24 hours and check back for potential problems with paint then remove the larger work of art 3 Removes Scratches from CDs and DVDs Compact Discs CDs and Digital Video Discs DVDs can provide many hours of entertainment to people of all ages Unfortunately they have proven to be somewhat fragile when not properly cared for This has left more than one CD or DVD thrown into a trash container long before its usefulness is gone You can save many of these discs by rinsing with water and then rubbing toothpaste the paste variety and not a gel over the surface of the CD or DVD where scratches occur Then rinse with warm water making sure that all toothpaste residue has been removed from the surface There should be some toothpaste in the cracks to create a smooth surface Dry well Test the results This process may need to be repeated if there are many scratches 4 Removes Pimples Fast Acne can be a real downer for your social life Many times you can feel the pimple coming on long before it makes its appearance Once it makes its grand entrance though toothpaste the old fashioned paste variety can zap that zit double quick Dab a little toothpaste on the pimple at night before going to bed and you should be well rid of the pimple by morning Just remember that whitening toothpastes contain hydrogen peroxide that can irritate or damage the skin This is also not suggested for people with extremely sensitive skin because it may irritate 5 Deodorize Hands Ever had an unpleasant aroma cling to your hands If you ve ever chopped onions or garlic you know all too well how some fragrances seem to follow you for hours no matter how many times you wash your hands Even certain cleaning products can linger on your hands for an unpleasant experience Next time this happens to you try using a small dab of toothpaste on your hands in addition to the soap you would ordinarily use When you think about it it makes sense Toothpaste works to remove the aroma from strong smelling foods from your mouth It can do the same for your hands 6 Prevent Mirrors from Fogging Foggy bathroom mirrors becoming a bummer Prevent the annoying fog by rubbing toothpaste on the mirror and then wiping it off Do this before your next shower and see how quickly you can go from the shower to the mirror and onto round two of your morning routine Saving just a few minutes by not waiting for the mirror to clear can make your morning more productive Hint This also works well to keep swimming goggles from fogging up Wipe toothpaste along the inside and wipe off before swimming 7 Removes Scuffs from Sneakers Looking for ways to get rid of scuff marks from sneakers Before you begin wipe the shoe with a damp cloth Remove any debris or dirt Use a plain toothpaste and rub it onto the white area of the shoe Rinse any remaining toothpaste This will remove the black marks and scuffs on the shoe and have them nice and white again Stubborn stains or scuffs may require additional toothpaste or multiple applications to remove completely 8 Cleans Shower Doors For this project you ll want to use a toothpaste with whitening ingredients Those ingredients are typically peroxide based or baking soda Avoid gel toothpaste Dampen a sponge and place a small amount of toothpaste in the center Use the sponge and toothpaste to clean the shower doors in a circular motion Allow plenty of time for the active ingredients to work on the soap scum then rinse When all is said and done you ll have clearer cleaner and soap scum free shower doors 9 Fills in Nail Holes in Walls This only works for small holes that are less than \u00bc The trick is in finding a toothpaste the same shade as your wall or a willingness to touch up the paint once the toothpaste sets Squeeze the toothpaste into the hole and use a putty knife to remove excess toothpaste that didn t quite make it into the mark This is a quick and inexpensive fix that is great for rentals or college apartments to cover up nail holes left over from posters calendars and photographs that graced the walls Sources Remove Marks Using Toothpaste Acne Treatment Uses of Toothpaste Cleaning Shower Doors Online Degrees in Dentistry You may

"http://thetyee.ca/Opinion/2012/01/24/Incurable-TB/"	"3488"	"{""title"":""The Tyee Have We Created an Incurable TB "",""body"":""Report from India suggests so Can we ever trounce the mutant bacteria New strain of TB may yet succumb to some antibiotic but victory will be short lived An obscure report from researchers in India appeared online late last year and sent a shiver through the medical community In the weeks since then the report has come under close scrutiny As well it should since it suggests we could lose a century of progress and find ourselves dying in the millions from tuberculosis just like our 19th century ancestors According to the original report published Dec 21 in Clinical Infectious Diseases a hospital in Mumbai India had identified 12 TB patients whose disease resisted all antibiotics Nothing worked with them All the patients appeared to have strains of TB known as multi drug resistant MDR TB and extremely drug resistant XDR TB They had been given antibiotics but had not completed their course of treatment Or they had been given the wrong antibiotics altogether a common experience worldwide Anything that doesn t kill the TB bacillus makes it stronger and the doctors at PD Hinduja Hospital found nothing that could kill these patients TB As an Indian news report began This is as scary as it can get Scary but not surprising Ever since the advent of sulfa drugs and penicillin we have been locked in an arms race with bacteria Antibiotics originally had wonderfully lethal effects on many infections But in some cases a few bacteria had genetic resistance to a given drug or the treatment wasn t long or intense enough Either way the survivors learned to best such drugs We came up with new drugs and again they worked until a few bacteria survived and multiplied The age of superbugs This is why we now have superbugs like MRSA multiple drug resistant Staphylococcus aureus and C difficile which spread easily in hospitals In 2005 94 000 Americans contracted MRSA and 18 650 died from it more than died from AIDS In Canada an estimated 220 000 hospital acquired infections result in at least 8 000 deaths a year According to the Public Health Agency of Canada drug resistant TB is not yet a problem here But out of 18 000 cases studied between 1998 and 2010 210 1 2 per cent were multi drug resistant and five 0 03 per cent were extremely drug resistant So the report of a totally drug resistant tuberculosis in India was not welcomed in India or anywhere else An Indian paper added to public worries by reporting in mid January that out of 100 randomly selected TB patients in Bangalore almost 1 000 kilometres from Mumbai six were carrying the TDR strain Impossible to contain A quick search on Google Scholar shows that the 12 Mumbai patients were not the first In 2006 an Iranian team in Tehran had identified 15 TDR TB cases in patients who included immigrants from Afghanistan Azerbaijan and Iraq And two women in Italy had died in 2003 after years of unsuccessful treatment with all available drugs This untreatable TB strain in other words has been around for over a decade and it has now turned up from Italy to Mumbai It seems unlikely that we will be able to contain it We can expect to find it in more places if only because we ll now be looking for it The implication of TDR TB is of course a rollback to the 19th century when consumption was a major cause of death around the world It is still a threat to poor people the World Health Organization says that one third of the world s population is currently infected with the TB bacillus WHO also estimates that 1 7 million people mostly Africans died of TB in 2009 4 657 deaths every day of the year So the prospect of untreatable TB is a disturbing one WHO notes that in the Americas only 2 1 persons per 100 000 die of TB With a totally drug resistant strain that rate could easily exceed Africa s current rate of 50 deaths per 100 000 Not everyone accepts the Mumbai findings The British medical journal The Lancet has reported on them without objections But WHO has published an FAQ that takes issue with the whole idea the term totally drug resistant tuberculosis is not yet recognised by the WHO For now these cases are extensively drug resistant tuberculosis XDR TB according to WHO definitions Indian health authorities have been quick to support WHO The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare also dismissed the Mumbai cases as XDR TB which itself was appalling when WHO first defined it in 2006 Grounds for caution Both institutions have reason to be politically cautious WHO was sharply criticized in 2009 when it declared the H1N1 flu to be a pandemic though very few people died from it India actively promotes medical tourism inviting westerners to take advantage of cheap surgery When the super resistant NDM 1 enzyme was identified last year in India the government and medical experts protested that it was just a plot to hurt the medical tourism industry Their effort at damage control backfired so WHO s skepticism about TDR TB was welcome This new strain of TB may yet succumb to some antibiotic we ll discover before long But even if we do succeed in controlling it our victory will be short lived TB and a host of other diseases will always mutate one step ahead of us Until we remove their root causes poverty malnutrition poor sanitation ignorance we will remain both their victims and their allies Crawford Kilian is a contributing editor of The Tyee "",""url"":""thetyee ca Opinion 2012 01 24 Incurable

A couple of weeks ago one of my regular visitors Ela reached out with a special request Can you feature a copycat recipe for The Cheesecake Factory Fresh Banana Cream Cheesecake Ela couldn t have reached out at a better time because I was planning to feature a recipe for Banana Cream Pie I was a bit concerned because we don t have a Cheesecake Factory in our area unfortunately no taste testing to be able to match the flavours and texture but after visiting their site and reading the description I was confident I could prepare the various elements of the dessert I m really happy Ela made the request because this isn t a typical cheesecake it s topped with a layer of luscious Bavarian Cream For those of you who have never tried Bavarian Cream it s very similar to pastry cream but rather than being thickened with flour or cornstarch it s thickened with gelatin Essentially it s a cr\u00e8me anglaise pouring custard thickened with gelatin and just prior to setting up heavy cream is first whipped to a soft peak and then folded into the custard Like cr\u00e8me anglaise extreme care must be taken when cooking the custard to prevent the eggs from curdling The custard must be cooked over a low flame and must never boil The custard is ready when it s thick enough to coat the back of a wooden spoon and reaches a temperature between 80 C to 82 C 175 F to 180 F Immediately after adding the gelatin the custard is typically cooled down quickly over an ice water bath before folding in the whipped cream Bavarian Cream or Crema Bavarese in Italian or Bavarois is usually flavoured with vanilla or liqueur Popular variations incorporate fruit pur\u00e9e If served as a dessert the Bavarian is classically set in a large fluted mold But it can also be served in glasses with a medley of fresh fruit My daughter Liana was invited to a dinner party at the home of her boyfriend s parents and she wanted to bring the cheesecake for dessert Although I d made more than one I was hesitant because I didn t have a chance to try the cheesecake before sending it along Was I successful in matching The Cheesecake Factory flavours and textures I haven t a clue But I m hoping Ela will be kind enough to report back once she s had a chance to try the recipe As for how the cheesecake was received Elisabeth the hostess was kind enough to send a message Hello Grace and thank you so very very much for the wonderful cheesecake you made for our dessert last night We all agreed it was the best cheesecake we ve ever eaten Really It was so light unlike most cheesecakes and the banana flavour was a delightful and delicious change Believe it or not I didn t try the cheesecake until yesterday I froze the smaller ones until Liana s schedule freed up to photograph the cheesecakes And I think she was finally able to set aside the time because her boyfriend Chad was eager to dive in again Unfortunately you can t really see how creamy the texture is in the images because the cakes were still frozen Let me assure you the texture is very creamy I did miss one element when I was trying to match The Cheesecake Factory Banana Cream Cheesecake the crust should have come up the sides of the cake I will definitely do this the next time I prepare it because the three creamy layers needs the textural contrast the crust provides And I might also add a nutty flavour to the crust either toasted macadamias or the classic pairing of walnuts To make the dessert extra special I would serve the cheesecake slices with caramelized bananas I ve made quite a few cheesecakes in the last little while Mango Cheesecake Chocolate Chip Cheesecake Cappuccino Fudge Cheesecake and now this Banana Cream Cheesecake You can t go wrong serving cheesecake for dessert it s a definite crowd pleaser The best part about them is their versatility The flavour possibilities are endless and so are the crust variations What s your favourite cheesecake Print Recipe Banana Cream Cheesecake Makes 1 23 cm 9 inch cheesecake Please note Instructions below are for preparing the 9 inch cheesecake If you would like instructions for the mini cakes please reach out through the comments and I will provide them to you To make the assembly of the cheesecake much easier I took the time to freeze the cheesecake and also the bavarian cream layer after refrigeration for about 30 minutes This step is optional but recommended especially during the warm weather months You ll notice in the photos above for the larger cake the Bavarian Cream Layer is about 2\u00bd to 4 cm high 1 to 1\u00bd inches forgot to measure if you prefer the layer not quite so high pour less Bavarian Cream into the mould and prepare some individual bavarian cream desserts in glasses and garnish with fresh fruit Stabilized Whipped Cream Nilla Wafer Cheesecake Crust Banana Cream Cheesecake Filling Vanilla Bean Bavarian Cream Stabilized Whipped Cream 560 ml 2\u00bc cups heavy whipping cream 35 well chilled 1 vanilla bean split and seeded 1\u00bd teaspoons unflavoured gelatine 45 ml 3 tablespoons cold water 40 g 5 tablespoons confectioners sugar sifted Combine cream vanilla bean and seeds in an airtight container whisk together until vanilla seeds are evenly distributed Cover and refrigerate until just prior to serving cheesecake Chill stand mixer bowl and whip attachment in the freezer 15 minutes In a small saucepan sprinkle gelatin over cold water let soften 5 minutes Place saucepan over low heat and stir until gelatin is dissolved Remove from heat and let cool Remove bowl and attachment from the freezer Pour chilled cream into chilled bowl Add the sugar and whisk at high speed until very soft peaks form Continue to whisk and gradually pour the gelatin mixture through a fine mesh sieve into the whipped cream beat until stiff peaks form Nilla Wafer Cheesecake Crust If you would like the crust to come up the sides of the cheesecake I would recommend using about 2 to 2\u00bc cups wafer cookie crumb and also increase the melted butter to between 86 to 100 g 6 or 7 tablespoons 156 g about 44 Nilla wafer cookies about 1\u00bc cups crumb 57 g \u00bc cup unsalted butter melted Preheat oven to 180 350 F For easier cheesecake removal unlatch 23 cm 9 inch springform pan and flip the base over lip facing down Line the base with a sheet of non stick baking paper leaving a 5 cm 2 inch border on all sides Reattach sides of springform pan making sure the lip is facing down In the bowl of a food processor process wafer cookies to a fine crumb Gradually pour the melted butter through the feed tube and process until crumbs are evenly moistened Press the crumb mixture evenly on the base of the springform pan Transfer to a rimmed baking sheet lined with non stick baking paper Bake the crust on the baking sheet until set about 8 minutes Remove from oven and transfer to a wire rack Let stand until completely cooled Banana Cream Cheesecake Filling 1000 g 4 x 8 ounce packages cream cheese room temperature Seeds from 1 vanilla bean or 2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract 225 g 1 cup caster superfine sugar 2 ripe bananas mashed 24 g 3 tablespoons plain all purpose flour sifted 4 large eggs room temperature 160 ml 2 3 cup buttermilk 60 ml \u00bc cup banana liqueur substitute with 60 ml \u00bc cup heavy whipping cream 35 1 teaspoon banana extract 1 to 2 tablespoons butter room temperature Preheat oven to 160 C 325 F Bring a teakettle of water almost to a boil Prepare springform pan for water bath cut heavy duty aluminum foil into three 40 cm 16 inch squares Layer aluminum squares on a flat work surface place the cooled springform pan in centre of square wrap foil tightly around and up the sides of the pan Place wrapped springform pan into a deep roasting pan large enough to comfortably fit the size of the springform pan In bowl of stand mixer fitted with paddle attachment beat the cream cheese at medium speed until smooth scraping down sides bottom of bowl and attachment occasionally Reduce mixer speed to low Add the vanilla seeds or extract and gradually add the sugar beat until smooth scraping down sides bottom of bowl and attachment as needed Add the mashed bananas and flour beat to just combine Add the eggs one at a time beating to just combine scraping down sides bottom of bowl and attachment after each addition Add the buttermilk banana liqueur and vanilla extract if using instead of the vanilla seeds beat to just combine Remove the bowl from the mixer Strain the filling through a fine mesh sieve into a pourable container and using flexible rubber spatula press through any solids Stir the mixture with the spatula to combine well Using pastry brush butter the sides of springform pan Pour the filling into the cooled crust Tap the springform pan gently on the counter to allow any air bubbles that may have formed to dissipate and transfer back to the prepared roasting pan Pull out the middle oven rack slightly just enough to comfortably fill the roasting pan with water place roasting pan on rack Carefully pour the hot water from the teakettle into the roasting pan filling about halfway up the side of the springform pan Carefully push the roasting pan into the centre of the oven rack and then ever so carefully push the oven rack back into the oven Bake until set around the edges and the centre of the cheesecake jiggles slightly when the springform pan is gently shaken 1 hour 15 minutes Remove from oven and transfer to a heatproof surface Immediately remove springform pan from water bath and transfer to wire rack Remove aluminum foil Run a thin knife around the edges of the pan and let stand at room temperature away from drafts until cooled completely Transfer cheesecake in springform pan uncovered or loosely covered to refrigerator to chill at least 6 hours preferably overnight or up to 2 days For best taste and texture allow cheesecake to chill for 2 days Remove from the refrigerator transfer cheesecake to freezer and chill 30 minutes Vanilla Bean Bavarian Cream To prepare a quick dessert serve Bavarian Cream in glasses garnished with fresh fruit 250 ml 1 cup 1 tablespoon whole milk 1 vanilla bean split and seeded or 2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract 5 g 3 sheets gelatine gold extra Dr Oetker 3 large egg yolks 57 g \u00bc cup caster superfine sugar 375 ml 1\u00bd cups heavy whipping cream 35 well chilled In a small saucepan bring milk vanilla bean and seeds just to the boil small bubbles forming around the sides of the pan over medium heat Remove from heat cover and let stand at room temperature allowing vanilla to infuse 15 to 20 minutes Line rimmed baking sheet with a sheet of non stick baking paper Place a sheet of plastic wrap on top of the baking paper Centre an 18 cm or 20 cm 7 inch or 8 inch ring mould or sides of a springform pan on the plastic wrap Tightly wrap the plastic up the sides of the mould and secure with an elastic band or tape wrap to mould Make sure the plastic wrap is smooth on the base of the mould Line the inside of the mould with acetate paper or non stick baking paper Soak the gelatin leaves in very cold water until softened 15 minutes Prepare an ice water bath fill a large bowl half full with ice and cover the ice with cold water Set aside In a large bowl using a large balloon whisk beat together the eggs and sugar until thick and pale Gradually add the hot milk mixture into the egg mixture whisking constantly until well combined Return the mixture to the saucepan and cook over low heat until mixture is thick enough to coat the back of a wooden spoon and reaches a temperature of between 80 C to 82 C 175 F to 180 F making sure the mixture does not boil Remove from heat Remove gelatin sheets from water squeeze out any excess liquid and add the to the milk mixture stirring until dissolved If using vanilla extract add to the mixture and stir to combine Strain the mixture through a fine mesh sieve into medium sized bowl Place bowl over water bath and stir occasionally until cool and slightly thickened Meanwhile in a large bowl use handheld electric mixture to beat the heavy cream to soft peaks Remove the bowl from the water bath and fold the whipped cream into the milk mixture in two additions Strain the cream through a fine mesh sieve into the prepared mould Use an offset spatula to level and spread the cream to the sides Cover the mould with plastic wrap and transfer to the refrigerator to set 3 to 4 hours Remove from the refrigerator transfer bavarian cream layer to the freezer and chill 30 minutes Assembling Cheesecake For an extra special dessert you may want to serve the cheesecake slices with caramelized bananas If you ve never prepared caramelized bananas please reach out via the comments I will be very happy to share the technique Fresh bananas cut on the diagonal optional to garnish Prepare whipped cream Remove cheesecake and bavarian cream layer from the freezer Working quickly unlatch the springform pan and with the help of a large spatula slide the cheesecake off the baking paper onto cake stand or plate the cheesecake will easily slide off because we took the time to flip the base over so that the lip is facing down Remove mould from bavarian cream layer remove acetate paper or baking paper With the help of a large spatula transfer bavarian layer to the top of the cheesecake making sure the layer is centred Transfer whipped cream to large pastry bag fitted with large decorative tip Decorate cheesecake as desired If desired use fresh bananas to garnish Buon Appetito You may also enjoy Related

salt herbs and peppers together Mix until well blended Use 1 2 to 2 3 cup for a 10 12 pound turkey May be stored for several months in an airtight covered jar Remove the giblets and neck rinse the turkey well with cold water and pat dry thoroughly with paper towels Take care to dry both inside cavities Place in a large pan and rub the interior and exterior of the bird with seasoning mix To allow for good oil circulation through the cavity do not truss or tie legs together Cut off the wing tips and plump little tail as they may get caught in the fryer basket Cover pan and place in refrigerator overnight Place the OUTDOOR gas burner on a level dirt or grassy area Never fry a turkey indoors in a garage or in any structure attached to a building Do not fry on wood decks which could catch fire or concrete which could be stained by the oil Safety tip have a fire extinguisher nearby for added safety Add oil to a 7 10 gallon pot with a basket or rack At the medium high setting heat the oil to 375 degrees F depending on the amount of oil outside temperature and wind conditions this should take about 20 40 minutes Meanwhile place the turkey in a basket or on a rack neck down When the deep fry thermometer reaches 375 degrees F slowly lower the turkey into the hot oil The level of the oil will rise due to the frothing caused by the moisture from the turkey but will stabilize in about one minute Safety tips to prevent burns from the splattering oil wear oven mitts gloves long sleeves heavy shoes and even glasses It is wise to have two people lowering and raising the turkey Immediately check the oil temperature and increase the flame so the oil temperature is maintained at 350 degrees F If the temperature drops to 340 degrees F or below oil will begin to seep into the turkey Fry about 3 4 minutes per pound or about 35 42 minutes for a 10 12 pound turkey Stay with the cooker at all times as the heat must be regulated When cooked to 170 degrees F in the breast or 180 degrees F in the thigh carefully remove the turkey from the hot oil Allow the turkey to drain for a few minutes Safety tip allow the oil to cool completely before storing or disposing Remove turkey from the rack and place on a serving platter Allow to rest for 20 minutes before carving NOTE Use only oils with high smoke points such as peanut canola or safflower oil To determine the correct amount of oil place the turkey in the pot before adding seasoning and add water until turkey is covered Measure the amount of water and use a corresponding amount of oil Dry the pot thoroughly

increasing waistline phenomenon I don t care if you were skinny as a rail when you were in high school as your age increases so does your belt size Whereas once you may have been able to eat anything you wanted now it seems that every Oreo or piece of pie is visible around your midsection at some point the following day But even if you decide to do something about it and trim down who in the heck knows where to start There are so many potions pills powders and exercises gadgets that it leaves many of us well sitting on the couch eating junk food as we watch all the commercials telling us how easy it is to lose weight Forget all the hype though as stripping fat off your body IS possible and in some cases it may be much easier than you thought Here are 7 fast diet tips that are easy to follow and will help you take up a strong offensive in your own battle of the bulge Eat breakfast Skipping breakfast seems like a great way to lose weight After all you are eating less calories right NOPE The best thing to do in the morning is grab a bite to eat so you can get your metabolism kicked into gear Your body will start burning calories right away Also if you DON T eat in the morning you are likely to be hungrier and then overeat when you do eventually sit down for a meal Plan your meals the night before When we are in a rush we shove whatever is available into our mouths which in turn often turns into fat on your bellies How many times have you excused yourself for hitting the fast food line because it was lunch time and you were in a rush Forget that just pack a little cooler the night before with healthy foods you like Yogurt bananas a sandwich made with whole wheat and lean meat When you get hungry you will have healthy foods at your fingertips you will eat better AND probably save a few bucks as well Write down what you eat BEFORE you eat it One of the best diet tips in the world is to write down everything you eat BEFORE you eat it Keeping a record of everything you eat is good but if you write it down BEFORE you eat it chances are you will eat less and healthier as well Think about it for once second we have all indulged ourselves a little too much at one time or another maybe choking back a piece of pie or 3 but would you really gorge yourself AFTER you saw it in print I know if I just wrote down 12 chocolate chip cookies and 32 ounces of milk I might look at it and then decide on a healthier choice Believe me it works Water with your meal always I know I know you like to drink soda with THIS food and milk with THAT food but if you can make water your drink of choice with EVERY meal you will consume less calories and aid digestion in the process No matter what drink choice you make if it isn t water chances are it s a bad one One common misconception is that fruit juice is as good as water NOT Fruit juice whether it s 100 juice or not contains TONS of sugar and calories If you are trying to lose weight it is best to limit juice big time as well Eat plenty of fiber Most of us need more fiber in our diets in general but if you are trying to lose fat this is even more crucial Fiber helps you feel full more quickly It doesn t digest either so it doesn t add any calories to your diet and as it moves through your digestive system it takes along with it fat and cholesterol Add fiber feel full lose weight it works Turn your plate into a rainbow The easiest tip for eating healthier and therefore losing weight is probably the rainbow principle The goal here is to choose as many colorful foods as possible Ok I am not talking about eating a bowl of fruit loops and calling it a day I am talking about foods that are colorful naturally These include greens such as broccoli asparagus spinach and orange carrots and red tomatoes etc Aim for a variety of colors with each meal and make the colorful ones that LARGEST portion Since meat is basically brown it doesn t count Colorful foods are healthy and low in calories Now go create a rainbow and lose some fat Skip the sugar pile on the protein Finally if you are looking to say bye bye to the belly try to reduce sugar intake wherever you can You like coffee Drink it black If you don t like it black you don t like coffee you like sugar Try making sugar free desserts TONS of recipes online Also try to limit your intake of white flour and white rice these also don t do you any favors Instead try to focus on the rainbow principle above along with eating portions of high quality protein Protein digests more slowly than carbohydrates and will help you feel full more quickly In addition protein will help you build more muscle if you are working out and muscle burns fat so grab a lean steak and then do some push ups The above tips may take a little getting used to After all we each get into our own routines and it is so much easier to keep doing what we have been doing than it is to try something new but if you are REALLY serious about getting rid of some fat the above 7 tips will help you do it Forget saying someday and just bite the bullet and make these tips your NEW routine You will be thinner and healthier in no time at all pin it one problem that most of us face as we get older is the ever increasing waistline phenomenon. i don\u2019t care if you were skinny as a rail when you were in high school, as your age increases, so does your belt size.

will embarrass my former boss You see she and I are two of a very small group of girl types in a very boy dominated sector of publishing and while I would normally argue that gender stereotypes are old tiresome and played out in our professional realm at least they re fairly rightly placed While the guys go on in great lengths about pick one or all of the below the Red Sox Giants hockey PlayStation Borat You The Man Now Dawg website beer and where it doesn t cost much and the Joy of Street Meat she and I would spend an at least equal amount of time and devotion chattering about all aspects of food and cooking as just my luck she is as obsessed as I am Having excellent taste she loves chocolate and Guinness in a near equal ratio thus when I happened upon this recipe many many months ago I bookmarked it for the express purpose of making for her birthday In the months since she s moved onto bigger better things Full time freelancing Breaking even Subverting the dominant paradigm fine I added that this recipe has drilled such a hole in my bookmarks I was unable to ignore it any longer busting it out for the birthday of a friend who ended up stuck in the airport from LA and didn t make back in time for Sunday night s dinner party and a sampling of her cake which as it turns out we were more than capable of enjoying without her Is this sentence still on Because really I feel no need to stop Now I ve explained before that I m not a huge fan of chocolate cakes as I think all that egg flour and baking powder dilute the inherent charm of true chocolate leaving you with things that taste chocolatey but are not that bite I crave covet and occasionally dream about But this cake is really fantastic The beer gives it a richer fuller nuttier flavor while keeping it from leaning too heavily on the sweet side the sour cream makes it an exceedingly moist cake that is neither mushy or unstructured without requiring any additional basting sealing or prayer to keep it on this side of the texture of stale cornbread and the chocolate ganache on top with a hint of coffee is like the crowning third of the flavor trifecta This cake kicks butt The original recipe at least according to the numerous amusing comments on Epicurious makes a stunning amount of batter I took several writers advice and halved it to fit in a bundt pan and decided to replace their sort of odd frosting suggestion with a basic failure free ganache the same that I had used for the orange chocolate chunk cake I reduced the recipe by one quarter remembering that it had made way too much but even a 75 percent it mostly puddled beneath the cooling rack clearly begging for a swipe from our hungry fingers Chocolate Stout CakeAdapted from the Barrington Brewery in Great Barrington MA via Bon Appetit This recipe was originally intended to make a layer cake of 3 8 inch rounds Upon many reviewers suggestions I halved it and it fit perfectly in a bundt pan The halved amount is below and the icing replaced with a simple ganache 1 cup stout such as Guinness 1 cup 2 sticks unsalted butter3 4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder preferably Dutch process 2 cups all purpose flour2 cups sugar1 1 2 teaspoons baking soda3 4 teaspoon salt2 large eggs2 3 cup sour cream6 ounces good semisweet chocolate chips6 tablespoons heavy cream3 4 teaspoon instant coffee granules Cake prep Preheat oven to 350 F Butter or spray a bundt pan well make sure you get in all of the nooks and crannies Some people even go so far as to brush the inside of their bundt pans with melted butter you cannot be too careful Bring 1 cup stout and 1 cup butter to simmer in heavy large saucepan over medium heat Add cocoa powder and whisk until mixture is smooth Cool slightly Whisk flour sugar baking soda and 3 4 teaspoon salt in large bowl to blend Using electric mixer beat eggs and sour cream in another large bowl to blend Add stout chocolate mixture to egg mixture and beat just to combine Add flour mixture and beat briefly on slow speed Using rubber spatula fold batter until completely combined Pour batter into prepared pan Bake cake until tester inserted into center comes out clean about 35 minutes Transfer cake to rack cool completely in the pan then turn cake out onto rack for drizzling ganache Ganache For the ganache melt the chocolate heavy cream and coffee in the top of a double boiler over simmering water until smooth and warm stirring occasionally Drizzle over the top of cooled cake Update 3 25 08 Previously the instructions suggested that you cool the cake for only 10 minutes in the pan before flipping it out onto a cooling rack and cooling it the rest of the way After several conversations with readers test cooks who found that their cake stuck a little awesome reader Susan

weekend is fitting I had planned on making this rainbow cake for weeks and finally got around to creating it yesterday Just as I finished up the cake last night New York voted to allow gay marriage Serendipitous timing I send love and congratulations to all of the LGBTs in New York we ve only got 40 something more states to go I also mentioned to a friend of mine that this newly passed law could single handedly save our economy gays planning weddings Alright on to the instructions for this cake I ll likely never bring up politics again on my baking blog so rest easy to those of you who don t agree with my views This cake was not difficult to make but it was very time consuming I think it worked on it for about 5 hours so it was a labor of love I think it would make a great cake for a kids birthday party I was OBSESSED with rainbows when I was a little girl and my parents would always buy a rainbow cake from our local bakery My cakes had four layers pink yellow green and purple and included raspberry filling between the layers I remember the anticipation and excitement of cutting into the cake and seeing all of the colors So much fun Rainbow Layer CakeRecipe adapted from The Tasty KitchenPrint Recipe For the cake 2 boxes white cake mix plus ingredients like eggs and oil as called for on the box mix Red orange yellow green blue and purple food coloring note I used whole milk instead of water as called for by the directions I think it leads to a denser and more tasty cake For the frosting 1 stick unsalted butter softened1 stick salted butter softed1 cup shortening1 Tablespoon clear vanilla if you want WHITE frosting 2 lbs powdered sugar4 6 Tablespoons milk note You may need to make a double batch of this frosting the rainbow cake is quite tall and uses a lot of frosting to cover it so be sure that you have enough of the frosting ingredients on hand in case you need to make another batch 1 Preheat oven to 350F and make 1 box cake mix according to box directions Separate the batter into 3 bowls with roughly 1 cup of cake batter per bowl Add food coloring purple blue green to each 2 Spray three 8 round cake pans with nonstick spray Bake cakes for about 17 20 minutes because of the small amount of batter the cake does not take long to bake Be sure to check on the cakes periodically to make sure they are not over baking Remove cakes from oven and cool on wire racks 3 Repeat this process with another box cake mix this time adding red orange and yellow food coloring You will end up with six cakes when you are finished baking 4 For the frosting cream the butters and shortening together Add the vanilla Slowly add the powdered sugar until incorporated Add 4 6 Tablespoons of milk as needed to thin the frosting Cake assembly 1 Level each cake with a large bread knife This is important because the cake layers will not sit evenly if they are not leveled and your cake won t be as pretty as it could be Don t worry about being perfect just try to get rid of the little dome that forms on top of baked cakes 2 Start with the PURPLE layer first Once leveled place the purple layer on your cake stand or plate I usually glue the first layer down by placing a small amount of frosting in the middle of the cake stand and then placing the cake on top Add enough frosting to cover the purple cake 3 Add the BLUE layer of the cake on top of the purple layer Add enough frosting to cover the top of the blue cake 4 Add the GREEN layer of the cake on top of the blue layer Add enough frosting to cover the top of the green cake At this point you will have a three layer cake Spread enough frosting around the outside of the cake to coat the entire cake this will be your crumb coat Don t worry if it s messy and don t try to be clean and perfect here just make sure that all of the cake is covered in frosting 5 Freeze your cake for 1 hour or refrigerate for 2 hours 6 Remove cake from the freezer or refrigerator and place the YELLOW layer on top of the green layer Add enough frosting to cover the top of the yellow cake 7 Add the ORANGE layer of the cake on top of the yellow layer Add enough frosting to cover the top of the orange cake 8 Add the RED layer of the cake on top of the orange layer Add enough frosting to cover the top of the cake At this point you will have a six layer cake Spread enough frosting around the outside of the yellow orange and red layers Again this should not be perfect Just slap some frosting onto the cake and get it covered 9 Freeze or refrigerate the cake one more time before beginning the final coat of frosting Cooling the cake down helps to keep it stable and prevents it from wobbling It is also MUCH easier to frost frozen cakes 10 Once cooled remove the cake from the freezer or refrigerator and begin the final stage of frosting This is where you will be able to make the cake look more smooth and pretty Add more frosting to the cake to thoroughly coat Use an off set spatula for this and dip it into hot water to help smooth the frosting over the cake If you d like add some frosting to a pastry bag and pipe a few polka dots or decorations on top of the cake Enjoy i usually don't love to bring up politics where they don't belong, but this weekend is fitting. i had planned on making this rainbow cake for weeks and finally got"",""url"":""withsprinklesontop p

up the money chart but needs to push a little further to make the LPGA Tour her dream since she was a little girl 44 Michelle Waterson MMA Does Michelle Waterson look like a person that could knock someone out If not do not underestimate her she has done it three times in her professional fighting career So the next time you are at a bar and decide to hit on the babe sitting alone better hope it

smoking hotties of any other sport Well no not really but they do have Biba Golic Biba played her college ball at Texas Wesleyan Univeristy which is not the Texas Western college you remember from the movie Glory Road But it is close 42 Beatriz Recari Golf If there was ever a female golfer you could consider a shark it is Beatriz Recari A shark Really Let me explain She has been sitting and waiting around ready to make her move to the top She has been living near the center of the pack but has the skill level to propel her to an elite status So she just sits and waits floating around like a

of them continue to make them time and time again One of those names is Ashely Judd She brings her passion and voice to every game she attends at the University of Kentucky She has had several run ins with rival fans however she probably ended up winning those arguments every time 39 Ali Krieger Soccer A loss to Japan in the semifinals of the 2011 FIFA Women s World Cup could have been the straw that broke the camel s back but not for Team USA and Ali Krieger She returned to Germany where she plays professionally for the FFC Frankfurt soccer club with an even bigger fan club and more knowledge of the game she loves so much it sent her overseas Did I mention she speaks self taught fluent German 38 Hannah Cornett Triathlete Hannah Cornett is not your average triathlete She is literally a multi talented sports guru Her resume includes triathlons pro mountain biking pro surfing modeling and acting It is nice to see some women can do almost everything and still have time to look beautiful 37 Almudena Cid Rhythmic Gymnasts How is Almudena Cid a sex symbol What does she bring to the table that all the others have not already Well for starters she can bend both her legs behind her ears And who said rhythmic gymnastics was boring 36 Gabrielle Union WAG Gabrielle Union has come a long way since Bring it On It seems like only yesterday we can remember seeing her bringing it and now we get to watch her grace the courtside of her man Dwayne Wade s Heat games Her sex appeal has followed her career and it does not stop there She earned her way onto this list after years of consistently being among the hottest WAGs in sports She has kept standing behind her man and his crazy ex wife sensational preseason free agent signings and everything that comes with being a Miami Heat superstar 35 Anna Rawson Golf Golf has come a long way since Arnold Palmer and Jack Nickalus The women have become more prominent than ever in a sport that was once dominated by men Anna Rawson is one of those women Her golf game is nowhere near the level of the above mentioned but her beauty elevates her overall quality in the female golfing world She brings in the fans when she plays Those long legs of hers can easily be the reason why she garners so much attention 34 Kim Kardashian WAG Kim Kardashian should have a show titled She does it again Every year something happens in the life of Kim that would make most of us crawl up into a box and ignore the rest of the world but not her She just keeps pushing forward In 2011 alone she broke up with Reggie Bush moved back home and married her new man Kris Humphries All that is left is a baby but we will not be starting those rumors yet 33 Allison Stokke Pole Vault Many female athletes have gone from nobody to somebody overnight but Allison Stokke is the only one to do it for five straight years She has done plenty of impressive things in the world of pole vaulting and we are all glad she chose that sport but it was back in 2007 when a random stranger caught the beautiful Stokke on camera just standing around that she can thank for the fame If her career is finished in sports she will always have a job as a model And that is not too shabby 32 Erin Andrews Reporter Erin Andrews or EA as she is known in the ESPN world continued right where Jill Arrington left off She made beautiful women working the sidelines of major sporting events the new thing to do She has even become a staple in the NCAA College Football video games each year For the ones of us wondering about this photo no it is not EA s twin but that is her sister and that means there are two beauties in the Andrews family in this world I am a fan of those odds 31 Maria Kirilenko Tennis What is it about Russian tennis players that drives all of us crazy Maria Kirilenko is the world s eighth ranked female tennis pro and an upgraded version of Anna Kournikova because she wins 30 Kim Glass Volleyball Female volleyball are not suppose to be hot

back on our television sets in 2012 for the London Summer games Time needs to speed up 29 Heather Mitts Soccer Heather Mitts joins a long list of University of Florida Alumni to make this list She has been around the game of soccer since she was eight years old She is now living the life She married NFL quarterback AJ Feeley in February of 2010 and recently participated on Team USA during the FIFA Women s World Cup She did not get any playing time during her time in Germany but she was definitely noticed on the sidelines 28 Stephanie Rice Swimming With the dominance of Michael Phelps in the past two Olympic games there was not a lot of attention paid to Stephanie Rice and her beautifully long body She managed to grab three gold medals and did it without anyone taking notice She is as dominant as the come in the aqua center but she is also the sexiest female swimmer in the world Holding both of those titles is something she should be proud of I know I would be 27 Danica Patrick Racing Why do so many people hate Danica Patrick When did she become the super villain in sports I am a big fan of hers I have been since she showed up on the racing scene a few years back She is playing in a sport dominated by men In fact she is the first woman to race in Nascar She might not be the Jackie Robinson of racing but she is still a great athlete and sex symbol for a sport that has none 26 Natalie Gulbis Golf Sophie Horn might have taken being sexy and playing golf to a whole new level but none of that would have been possible had it not been for Natalie Gulbis She not only

to their second child back in July Her beauty has been featured in many sports lists and her sex appeal reminds me that she should now be included in the hottest MILF lists 14 Hope Solo Soccer What do

world she also has the best name in modern sports history You can say what you want but her name is perfect for any athlete 13 Leyrn Franco Javelin What does a javelin thrower from Paraguay do when it

Ana Ivanovic 1 She use to practice tennis in between NATO bombing raids in Belgrade in 1999 2 Monica Seles is the reason she is a professional tennis player 3 She once had a serve clock in at 124 9mph

wearing a bra It is suppose to be invisible to the naked eye And you would have known this too had you not watched the commercial first How can any man explain what these bra s are suppose to do when the commercials are filled with Adriana Lima and friends dancing around in lingerie 9 Jenn Brown Reporter What was once Erin Andrews walking the sidelines is now Jenn Brown She has replaced EA on several different fronts but most importantly because she is better to look at on weekends 8 Gina Carano MMA A sex symbol should be a person that symbolizes sex appeal Gina Carano not only symbolizes sex appeal she has transformed a sport using it The UFC has been popular for many years but it was not until the world was introduced to Gina Carano that we became interested in female s fighting in mixed martial arts Now we love to watch women kick the crap out of each other 7 Alex Morgan Soccer Team USA soccer had a fantastic 2011 Even though most fans would say it was a disappointing year finishing second place in the world for the FIFA Women s World Cup is not bad at all It also gave us Alex Morgan She had been floating around for quite some time I even featured her in a few of my own articles in the past It was not until she had a few clutch goals including one against Japan in the finals that we all began to take notice Besides the world already knowing our women can play some soccer they now know we bring the sex appeal every where we go 6 Irina Shayk WAG How could I not include the always beautiful Irina Shayk She is the first woman to control Real Madrid star and international soccer phenom Cristiano Ronaldo Before Ms Shayk Ronaldo was in the media flaunting another trophy actual and metaphorical every other week Now I am not saying she has stopped his

June 30th 2011 Abigail Clancy s wedding date when I was still hoping there was a chance she would dump Peter Crouch No offence to him he might be a nice guy even though he did cheat on her once

ask them who they thought was the most beautiful among all of them I bet all the money in my pockets they would say Sophie Horn Sophie Horn went from a really good female golfer to an international sex symbol almost overnight Not only is she good at golf but she is also a certified trainer and it shows How many women do you know can claim to be a model trainer and professional golfer 2 Darya

"http://www.fieggen.com/shoelace/hiddenknotlacing.htm"	"3741"	"{""title"":""Ian s Shoelace Site Hidden Knot Lacing "",""body"":""Hidden Knot Lacing By hiding the knot underneath the result is an uninterrupted series of straight bars that looks particularly distinctive on dress shoes or sneakers alike Faint sections are underneath Here s where the knot is tied Finished lacing with knot and loose ends tucked into the shoe This pic of black Orisis sneakers with white Hidden Knot Lacing was sent to me by Yoana G More Lacing Photos Lacing Technique 1 Lace the shoe as per Straight Bar Lacing except that the left blue end is made shorter and the right yellow end is made longer 2 Run the the left blue end only as far as the second eyelet from the top left ending up inside the shoe 3 Run the right yellow end across the top pair of eyelets also ending up inside the shoe 4 The ends now meet between the top left eyelet and the next eyelet down Carefully tie the knot inside the shoe at that point This can either be tied with a Standard Shoelace Knot or with a simpler knot like a Reef Knot as shown in the diagram at left 5 Finally tuck the loose ends inside the shoe wherever they are most comfortable Features Distinctive look Tricky to tie knot Slight discomfort Comparative Length 81 Laced area uses less about 19 Shorter laces needed about 9 Lengthens lace ends about 17 More details NOTE Any discomfort that may be caused by the knot and loose ends being tucked into the shoe can be reduced by positioning the knot on the outer side of your foot Note also that like some other versions of Straight Lacing this method only works correctly on shoes with even numbers of eyelet pairs eg 6 pairs 12 eyelets This is because an even number of passes across the shoe is needed for the lace ends to meet and to be tied together Shoes with an odd number of eyelet pairs eg 7 pairs 14 eyelets finish with the lace ends diagonally opposite each other at the top of the shoe Despite this limitation Straight Lacing is very popular It s therefore not surprising that people have developed all sorts of ways to get it to work on shoes with odd numbers of eyelet pairs eg the grey Puma sneaker at left See below for some other workarounds Sports Military Advice Like other straight lacing methods Hidden Knot Lacing has an additional benefit for sporting or military use The upper horizontal sections of shoelace can be quickly cut through with a knife or scissors in order to more easily remove a boot from a broken sprained or otherwise injured ankle or foot Note that most military forces have regulations for just about everything so I d recommend that military personnel check before they adopt this or any other possible non regulation lacing method Odd Workarounds As mentioned above Hidden Knot Lacing only works correctly on shoes with even numbers of eyelet pairs On shoes with odd numbers of eyelet pairs the ends don t meet at the top instead ending up diagonally across from each other Here s several common workarounds using a shoe with seven pairs of eyelets as an example Skip One Eyelet Pair One solution is to simply not use either the top or the bottom pair of eyelets Using only an even number of eyelet pairs avoids the odd limitation It s also possible to skip a pair of eyelets somewhere in the middle which breaks the lacing into two sections One Diagonal Use a single diagonal crossover somewhere in the lacing At the top it s less noticeable due to the bows shoelace ends At the bottom you can even run the diagonal around the inside of the tongue making it invisible at the expense of some slight discomfort Near the middle of the lacing a diagonal may be positioned to line up with and run through a tongue centering loop if the shoe has one One Crossover Instead of trying to hide a single diagonal this alternative makes a feature out of a single crossover similar to the look of Over Under Lacing This crossover can be placed at either the top or bottom of the lacing but unlike the above One Diagonal variation it cannot be placed in the middle of the lacing Cut and Tie Off Similar to the single diagonal shown above the shoelace can be cut where the diagonal would have been and the ends tied off on opposite sides of the shoe In this diagram the knotted ends are hidden underneath the bottom left eyelet and the second from bottom right eyelet Double Overlap This unusual solution works by doubling up the laces through the second from bottom pair of eyelets Because it s near the bottom of the shoe any difficulty with tightening this section is not so noticeable as the shoe doesn t need to open wide at that point Across and Back The second from bottom straight section runs across left to right on top then right to left underneath passing under itself on the left side The underlying section is fairly well hidden by the straight section on top This is the preferred method for dress shoes with three pairs of eyelets with the lacing running across back under the middle pair of eyelets This list of workarounds is by no means complete Once you accept that there s no perfect solution and that you must compromise in some way it s up to you what you throw into the lacing to get it to work whether it be a visible crossover or gap or something invisible that may be uncomfortable Please only vote once multiple votes

thought worthy Some we eventually rejected for being too basic hard cooking an egg for example others missed the cut because we felt they might be too obscure butter poaching fish or too advanced caramelizing sugar In the end we agreed on 10 techniques that for the most part fell into two categories The first covers tricks or methods we consider indispensable ones that appear in recipes over and over dicing an onion efficiently for example breading chicken or meat or making a pan sauce The second category is made up of techniques such as folding or making a roux that might stop someone from attempting a recipe We ve described and illustrated each of the 10 in today s Food section And as a bonus we ve also videotaped each one step by step You can view those videos on sfgate com food then practice what you ve learned with the accompanying recipes Crispy Chicken Salad for example employs three techniques breading segmenting citrus and making a vinaigrette To hone your skills tempering folding and rolling out pie dough try the Coconut Custard Pie Today s 10 techniques are just a starter We ll follow up with future Kitchen Essentials stories on stocking a pantry our favorite tools and appliances and more cooking techniques The 10 today provide a baseline Once you ve mastered these there s always sugar waiting to be caramelized Breading This easy three step technique ensures an even crumb coating It s commonly used on thin cuts of chicken pork or veal that will be fried or baked To begin set up your breading station Fill the first of three shallow dishes with flour In the second dish make an egg wash by whisking eggs with a little bit of water milk or other liquid or seasoning Finally place your breadcrumbs or other crumbs into the third dish Start by dredging a piece of meat in the flour Dredging means to thinly coat the meat with the flour then shake off any excess This eliminates much of the moisture from the surface of the meat and provides something for the egg wash to grab onto The second step is to dip the meat into the egg wash again letting the extra drip off At this point you ll basically have a paste for the crumbs to adhere to Finally press the meat into the crumbs coating evenly Try to work with one hand as you complete the process so as not to bread your fingers on both hands that can lead to a sticky mess Proceed with the recipe as directed Browning Searing Myths abound about the benefits of searing most notably that it seals in the juices In reality searing or browning meat or fish creates a caramelized golden crust that adds texture and a depth of flavor The most important factor in this technique is to start with a very hot pan Ideally you should use one made from a stainless steel or anodized metal a heavy material that will conduct and distribute heat evenly and well Although you can use nonstick pans for delicate fish pans without a nonstick finish do a better job of browning and leave lovely browned flavorful bits to use in a pan sauce see Making pan sauce To brown heat a completely dry pan then add enough oil to lightly coat the surface if you re using meat that has a lot of fat you can skip this step and put it directly into the dry pan The oil should heat to the point where it shimmers but does not smoke You can test this by flicking a droplet of water into the pan if the pan is ready the water should sizzle and evaporate upon contact Place your ingredient directly into the pan It will hiss at first but let it cook until a golden brown crust forms If the pan is heated properly the ingredient won t stick to the pan and you ll be able to lift it with tongs or a spatula easily Keep in mind that if you overcrowd the pan the ingredients will steam rather than brown so sometimes you ll need to cook in batches It s OK to wipe out the pan in between but leave the fond the brown bits that stick to the bottom Dicing an onion If done properly dicing an onion is very simple If you ve never attended culinary school or worked in a restaurant kitchen there s a good chance you ve never learned the proper method It s little more than three basic cuts Before you begin make sure your chef s knife is very sharp so that it slides easily through the onion This will help your watering eyes too Cut off the stem end of the onion trim the root end then halve the onion from top to bottom This will give each half a flat side to place on the board Leave the root end which will be tighter than the stem end intact to hold the onion together peel off the skin and starting with one half face the root end away from you on the cutting board Holding the onion firmly on either side proceed by making vertical cuts along the onion half spacing them according to the desired thickness of the dice You ll want to angle your knife inward at the sides to hold the onion together as you cut along the half Again leave the root end intact and don t cut all the way through to the root Next make horizontal cuts With your knife parallel to the cutting board slice the onion spacing according to your desired dice size and not cutting all the way through the root end Finally cut the onion cross wise releasing the diced onions in each layer as you cut toward the root end When you ve reached the final piece lay it flat on the cutting board and make cuts in both directions to finish the dice This technique can also be used to dice shallots Folding Folding is used in souffles cake batters or any recipe that calls for combining two ingredients of different densities Usually whipped egg whites or whipped cream is incorporated into a heavier batter or custard to lighten the batter In the case of egg whites the air that has been incorporated into the whipped whites acts as leavening to help cakes or souffles rise With the heavier batter in a bowl gently deposit about a quarter of the egg whites or whipped cream on top of the batter Using a rubber spatula gently reach down through the whites and batter to the bottom of the bowl and lift the some of the batter up along the edge of the bowl and over the whites in the center It s all about the twist of the wrist With each folding motion turn the bowl slightly Continue this motion until there are no traces of egg white left Starting with a quarter of the whites or cream will lighten the batter enough so that when you add the remaining egg whites or cream all at once you can easily fold using the same technique Be careful to combine the two ingredients quickly but gently so as not to deflate the air bubbles Making pan sauce One of our all time favorite techniques making a pan sauce is a great secret for home cooks Within minutes you can create a quick professional tasting meal using just a few ingredients This method utilizes the brown bits on the bottom of a pan called fond that appear after you ve used the searing or browning technique with anything from meat or poultry to fish We like to start by sauteing some diced shallots or other aromatics for added flavor either in the fat leftover from browning the meat or in a little extra olive oil or butter Next add liquid to the hot pan and bring to a simmer You can use wine stock vinegar juice or other flavored liquid Use a wooden spoon or spatula to scrape the fond from the bottom of the pan and incorporate it into the sauce adding color and flavor This is called deglazing Reduce the sauce by letting it simmer and cook down which concentrates the flavors and thickens the sauce How long it simmers depends on how much liquid you add but it s never more than a few minutes To finish remove the pan from the heat and whisk in cold cubes of butter which will further thicken the sauce add extra richness and provide luster Season it with salt and pepper and you ll have a finished sauce that will enhance a main course Rolling out pie crust Even the most experienced baker can have trouble rolling out a pie crust and getting it into the pan It s a technique that above all else requires practice Plus outside factors like the temperature of the room or the dough can affect success Start with a flattened round of pie dough that has been chilled in the refrigerator You want it to be cold enough so the butter or fat doesn t melt but malleable enough that you can roll it out somewhat easily with a rolling pin Have a pile of flour on hand for dusting it s imperative to spread it on your work surface sprinkle it on top of the dough and rub some onto the rolling pin to ensure that nothing sticks Starting in the center of the dough make short strokes toward the edges in different directions turning the dough often as it becomes thinner to maintain a circular shape Sprinkle the work surface and dough with flour as needed to prevent sticking avoid adding too much flour which will toughen the dough Stop rolling when the dough is about 2 3 inches larger than your inverted pie pan Place the rolling pin on the edge of the dough that s farthest away from you and roll the dough around the pin toward you until you have about half of it on the pin Gently move the rolling pin over the pie pan and slowly unroll the dough draping and centering it over the pan and gently lift and coax down into the edges Lightly press the dough into the bottom corners of the pan Using a sharp knife trim the excess dough around the outside leaving a 1 2 to 1 inch overhang that you can roll under the border to create a thick edge which gives the crust stability as it bakes Decorate the border as desired either with the tines of a fork or your fingers Making a roux A roux is the traditional way to thicken and enrich gravies sauces and soups It s essential to making our Best Way Gravy that is part of our Thanksgiving section every year and is used often in Cajun Creole cooking A roux is a cooked mixture of equal weights of flour and fat we generally use butter So one stick of butter or four ounces would be blended with four ounces of flour usually a little more than what would fit into a dry half cup measure To make the roux start by melting the butter in a heavy bottom saucepan until it foams and bubbles Add the flour all at once whisking constantly until the two are combined and a smooth consistency has formed It s important to cook the mixture for at least 2 to 3minutes At this point you have a blond or white roux which is used to thicken soups or sauces like bechamel or veloute where the lighter color plays a key role Beyond that the roux will take on different characteristics depending on how long it cooks in the pot Between 5 and 10 minutes the roux will develop a light brown hue and a nutty flavor good for thickening dishes like beef stew In Cajun Creole cooking recipes most often call for a dark brown roux which has been cooked for 20 to 25 minutes Keep in mind that the longer roux cooks the nuttier and richer the flavors become but it will also lose thickening power as it darkens which means you ll have to make more To thicken your dish cook it with the roux mixed in for at least 15 to 20 minutes This will cook out the starchy flour flavor and bring the dish to the desired consistency Segmenting citrus Orange or other citrus segments also known as supremes make a beautiful presentation when they are removed from the peel pith and membrane We love them on salads over fish or in desserts Cut off the top and bottom of the fruit so that it sits flat on the cutting board With a small sharp knife cut away one section of peel and bitter white pith following the natural curve of the fruit from top to bottom Continue around the citrus cutting away sections of the peel and pith as you go Trim any leftover pith once the peel has been removed Holding the fruit in your hand with a bowl underneath make two cuts within the membrane on either side of a segment and with the second cut lift the segment out of the membrane Place the fruit on a plate or in another bowl Continue around the whole fruit in the same fashion The juice will drip into the bowl as you work allowing you to save it for another use such as vinaigrette The peeling portion of this technique can be used for any rounded fruit with a rind such as melons and pineapples Tempering This technique refers to a method that blends ingredients of two different temperatures Most often we use it to incorporate cold eggs into hot liquid such as milk or cream when making custard ice cream or other dishes where eggs are the main thickener In its most basic form tempering involves gradually pouring hot liquid into the eggs in a steady stream while whisking constantly which slowly raises the temperature of the mixture without curdling or scrambling it Once enough of the hot liquid has been incorporated the egg mixture can be poured back into the original liquid where it will begin to thicken the liquid as it continues to cook Note Tempering chocolate is a different process that produces shiny smooth chocolate after melting Making a vinaigrette Knowing how to make a vinaigrette always comes in handy It s something that can be made on a whim with pantry staples and it tastes much better and fresher and is more economical than bottled dressing The basic ratio for vinaigrette is one part vinegar to three parts oil although if you substitute something less acidic like lemon juice for the vinegar you ll want to lessen the oil accordingly As with anything else you ll get the best results if you use the highest quality ingredients You ll need both hands to make a vinaigrette one to pour in the oil and the other to whisk To that end it s important that the bowl sit stationary on the counter If you don t have a rubber bottomed bowl you can shape a towel in a ring around the bottom of the bowl to provide traction Start by dissolving a little bit of salt in the vinegar Though you can season the dressing at the end the salt will dissolve more readily directly in the vinegar Add a small amount of Dijon mustard which acts as an emulsifying agent binding together the oil and vinegar Whisk in the mustard until well combined then slowly pour the oil in a steady stream whisking constantly until the dressing is blended and emulsified If desired you can season with pepper or more salt to taste Experiment with this basic vinaigrette by changing the type of oil or vinegar or by enhancing the dressing with other ingredients like herbs garlic shallots or citrus zest It can be tossed with salad greens or drizzled over grilled vegetables pasta salad fish or meat to finish a dish Crispy Chicken Orange Fennel Salad with Champagne Citrus Vinaigrette Serves 6 Techniques used Videos Breading Segmenting Citrus Making a Vinaigrette The chicken 1 3 cup flour 1 teaspoon

critics say that its sticky One person called it tasteless A Pour on the glaze while the cupcakes are still slightly warm like I say it will soak in a bit and some of the moisture will be taken out of the glaze and into the cupcake once you let it set up a bit it shouldn t be sticky B I still don t know how it could be tasteless with both shnapps and root beer in it I wanted to eat the stuff with a spoon I did not add shnapps to the buttercream as thats the vanilla float part If you think it has to do with proportions of wet to sugar take it up with Paula Dean as its an adaptation of a glaze she made for Lemon Blossoms 4 Someone brought up a very good point I say to fill the liners to the top with the batter that works for my oven they puff perfectly But I forgot my Alton Brown and every oven is different so filling to the top may not work for you so if you are worried don t do it but you will end up with a few more cupcakes Root beer floats are one of those things that my brothers and I loved as kids I don t know about them but for me its still something that I love to have on occasion That s why I wanted to make a cupcake that tasted like a root beer float I mean come on nothing is more fun than a cupcake or root beer floats why not combine the two Now I did find a couple recipes online that just added a can or two of root beer to the batter Not good enough for me the flavor of the root beer kind of faded away And I was super picky about the flavor on this one It s taken several tries at this recipe to get it right First round I tried using spices and ingredients that are used in root beer as well as a can of root beer but it ended up tasting more like a spice cake not bad but not what I wanted Second round I tried reducing a lot of root beer in a sauce pan to make a syrup and adding a can of root beer but the flavor wasn t to strong I think that boiling the root beer made the flavor evaporate and I didn t use an old fashioned root beer and the flavor didn t bake well Third round Eureka The only change that I would make is to use cupcake liners as the cake can easily fall apart during the tipsy phase And here s the recipe Enjoy Root Beer Float Cakes Cake Ingredients 1 cup root beer schnapps1 1 2 cups old fashioned style root beer like A W or Dads 2 tsp vanilla extract2 cups dark brown sugar1 cup butter2 eggs3 cups all purpose flour1 Tbs baking powder2 tsp baking soda1 tsp salt Root Beer Glaze 4 cups confectioners sugar1 3 cup root beer3 Tbs root beer schnapps 3 Tbs vegetable oil for a more kid friendly version replace schnapps with more root beer You will also need some extra root beer schnapps 1 Tbs per cupcake Or for the kiddies use root beer again 1 Tbs per cupcake You will also need some basic Vanilla buttercream there are many recipes online to try J Directions 1 Preheat oven to 350\u00baF 2 In a bowl mix together root beer schnapps root beer and vanilla extract Set aside 3 In a separate bowl cream together butter and sugar until light and fluffy 4 Add eggs mix until smooth5 Sift in flour baking soda baking powder and salt 6 Mix with hand mixer on low while slowly pouring in root beer mixture 7 Mix until smooth and lump free 8 Pour into lined cupcake pan Use foil cupcake liners to avoid leakage later Fill nearly to the top you may think its over filled but it puffs up perfectly this way Don t be tempted to use more than 24 cupcake cups trust me 9 Bake for 15 20 minutes until golden brown and cake springs back when touched 10 While cupcakes are baking prepare your butter cream and root beer glaze For glaze put all ingredients into a bowl and mix with a wisk until smooth and lump free 11 To assemble start by letting cupcakes cool still in the pan 12 While still slightly warm pour 1 Tbs of root beer schnapps over each cupcake Pour on slowly to allow schnapps or regular root beer for the kiddies to soak in 13 Once the schnapps has soaked in and let sit for a few minutes pour a couple tablespoons of glaze over each cupcake 14 When the glaze sets up a bit and isn t too runny put a scoop of buttercream atop each For an added touch you can even place a root beer barrel candy on each one Makes 2 dozen cupcakes

says he won't host 'tonight show' after leno"",""body"":""Conan O Brien released a statement Tuesday saying that he no longer wanted to be the host of The Tonight Show on NBC if it appeared at 12 05 a m Mr O Brien s brief run as host at 11 35 p m is to be cut short next month as NBC decided to restore his predecessor Jay Leno to that time period Mr O Brien has been growing increasingly upset in recent days about how he believes he was treated by NBC s management A representative for Mr O Brien said Tuesday that the issue came to a head for the host on Monday and that he had sat up all night drafting the statement NBC whose Tonight Show has been broadcast at 11 35 p m for decades declined to comment Mr O Brien was scheduled to do The Tonight Show on Tuesday night In a statement Tuesday afternoon Mr O Brien said I sincerely believe that delaying the Tonight Show into the next day to accommodate another comedy program will seriously damage what I consider to be the greatest franchise in the history of broadcasting The Tonight Show at 12 05 simply isn t the Tonight Show Mr O Brien s comments came two days after NBC formally outlined a plan to move The Jay Leno Show to 11 35 p m in March elbowing Mr O Brien s Tonight Show back half an hour Mr Leno seems supportive of the plan In his statement Mr O Brien rejects it outright The statement reads People of Earth In the last few days I ve been getting a lot of sympathy calls and I want to start by making it clear that no one should waste a second feeling sorry for me For 17 years I ve been getting paid to do what I love most and in a world with real problems I ve been absurdly lucky That said I ve been suddenly put in a very public predicament and my bosses are demanding an immediate decision Six years ago I signed a contract with NBC to take over The Tonight Show in June of 2009 Like a lot of us I grew up watching Johnny Carson every night and the chance to one day sit in that chair has meant everything to me I worked long and hard to get that opportunity passed up far more lucrative offers and since 2004 I have spent literally hundreds of hours thinking of ways to extend the franchise long into the future It was my mistaken belief that like my predecessor I would have the benefit of some time and just as important some degree of ratings support from the prime time schedule Building a lasting audience at 11 30 is impossible without both But sadly we were never given that chance After only seven months with my Tonight Show in its infancy NBC has decided to react to their terrible difficulties in prime time by making a change in their long established late night schedule Last Thursday NBC executives told me they intended to move the Tonight Show to 12 05 to accommodate the Jay Leno Show at 11 35 For 60 years the Tonight Show has aired immediately following the late local news I sincerely believe that delaying the Tonight Show into the next day to accommodate another comedy program will seriously damage what I consider to be the greatest franchise in the history of broadcasting The Tonight Show at 12 05 simply isn t the Tonight Show Also if I accept this move I will be knocking the Late Night show which I inherited from David Letterman and passed on to Jimmy Fallon out of its long held time slot That would hurt the other NBC franchise that I love and it would be unfair to Jimmy So it has come to this I cannot express in words how much I enjoy hosting this program and what an enormous personal disappointment it is for me to consider losing it My staff and I have worked unbelievably hard and we are very proud of our contribution to the legacy of The Tonight Show But I cannot participate in what I honestly believe is its destruction Some people will make the argument that with DVRs and the Internet a time slot doesn t matter But with the Tonight Show I believe nothing could matter more There has been speculation about my going to another network but to set the record straight I currently have no other offer and honestly have no idea what happens next My hope is that NBC and I can resolve this quickly so that my staff crew and I can do a show we can be proud of for a company that values our work Have a great day and for the record I am truly sorry about my hair it s always been that way Yours ConanAfter 16 years of making a name with his distinctive brand of intellectually silly comedy on the Late Night show on NBC Mr O Brien replaced Mr Leno as the host of The Tonight Show a mere seven months ago He is just the fifth man to lead Tonight after Steve Allen Jack Paar Johnny Carson and Mr Leno Mr Leno meanwhile moved to prime time in September as the host of The Jay Leno Show But the 10 p m experiment was a bust for many NBC affiliates which have seen the ratings for their late local newscasts plummet Amid mounting pressure to scrap the talk show NBC announced on Sunday that Mr Leno s last show at 10 p m would be Feb 11 and indicated that The Jay Leno Show would be shown at 11 35 p m instead NBC will begin showing the Winter Olympics the next day setting the stage for a new schedule on March 1 But the network acknowledged that day that Mr O Brien was not yet on board with the move Ever since the Leno to 11 35 move was described in the news media last Thursday people close to Mr O Brien have said privately that he is upset with the plan Fox has expressed interest in starting a late night show starring Mr O Brien provided he found a way to extricate himself from his NBC contract On Monday Kevin Reilly the president of Fox Entertainment strongly endorsed Mr O Brien in an interview He would be a very compatible fit for our brand Mr Reilly said He is one of the few guys on the planet that has demonstrated he can do one of these shows every night Mr O Brien s contractual complications were outlined in an article on Tuesday in The New York Times Update 5 26 p m The Internet has voted and it s supporting Mr O Brien in his struggle

Pierre Herm\u00e9 s recipe for to die for chocolate cookies in her Paris Sweets cookbook she called them Korova Cookies Sabl\u00e9s Korova after the restaurant off the Champs \u00c9lys\u00e9es for which Pierre Herm\u00e9 created these cookies not the milk bar in A Clockwork Orange In her most recent book she calls them World Peace Cookies as her neighbor became convinced that a daily dose of these cookies was all that is needed to ensure planetary peace and happiness While world peace is truly a lofty and admirable goal it s unfortunately not cutting it in my apartment as if you were standing in front of me holding one I would probably try to take it from you Just ask my husband I don t know if it because this is another frantic entry in those 28 day must eat chocolate or else I will die files or because they are the best chocolate cookie I have eaten in my entire life but there is nothing peaceful about my relationship to them My original intention was to do what I typically do when I want to make something gloriously unhealthy but limit my intake of it bring the remainders to work foisting the calories on those youthful things with whom I share cubicle walls But unable to part with them we ve hidden them in the freezer which I can assure you is not working either They re not even particularly charming when frozen but they do still exist or at least several of them do So there s that If you haven t yet abruptly stopped reading this tired and typical battle of weak will versus good intention and rushed to the kitchen to gather your butter and cocoa perhaps this will convince you the cookies are as sandy and light as you would expect from a sable but dark as midnight and as zeroed in on flavor as a pressed fudge brownie It s impossible to eat one warm from the oven without a milk chaser right from the carton Those tiny dabs of bittersweet chocolate are like that good thing that happens on a day you thought couldn t get any better For me You shouldn t have But she did And I did And it s getting bad so bad that I didn t work from home today as I had originally intended to for the sole purpose of putting some distance between me and World Peace I m sure you understand Okay fine I ll say it Some kind folks have nominated this here Smitten Kitchen for a Best Food Blog Humor Category award over at the Well Fed network Um me Funny If the people say so Alas I m tr\u00e9s flattered and encourage you to go over there and vote your conscience in this and all of the other categories And then please Come over to my place and pry these cookies from my clutches When I m done with The Yelling and The Biting and possibly The Crying I will thank you I promise World Peace Korova CookiesParis Sweets Dorie Greenspan Makes about 36 cookies 1 1 4 cups 175 grams all purpose flour1 3 cup 30 grams unsweetened cocoa powder1 2 teaspoon baking soda1 stick plus 3 tablespoons 11 tablespoons or 150 grams unsalted butter at room temperature2 3 cup 120 grams packed light brown sugar1 4 cup 50 grams sugar1 2 teaspoon fleur de sel or 1 4 teaspoon fine sea salt1 teaspoon vanilla extract5 ounces 150 grams bittersweet chocolate chopped into chips or a generous 3 4 cup store bought mini chocolate chips Sift the flour cocoa and baking soda together Working with a stand mixer preferably fitted with a paddle attachment or with a hand mixer in a large bowl beat the butter on medium speed until soft and creamy Add both sugars the salt and vanilla extract and beat for 2 minutes more Turn off the mixer Pour in the flour drape a kitchen towel over the stand mixer to protect yourself and your kitchen from flying flour and pulse the mixer at low speed about 5 times a second or two each time Take a peek if there is still a lot of flour on the surface of the dough pulse a couple of times more if not remove the towel Continuing at low speed mix for about 30 seconds more just until the flour disappears into the dough for the best texture work the dough as little as possible once the flour is added and don t be concerned if the dough looks a little crumbly Toss in the chocolate pieces and mix only to incorporate Turn the dough out onto a work surface gather it together and divide it in half Working with one half at a time shape the dough into logs that are 1 1 2 inches in diameter Wrap the logs in plastic wrap and refrigerate them for at least 3 hours The dough can be refrigerated for up to 3 days or frozen for up to 2 months If you ve frozen the dough you needn t defrost it before baking just slice the logs into cookies and bake the cookies 1 minute longer Getting ready to bake Center a rack in the oven and preheat the oven to 325 F 160 C Line two baking sheets with parchment or silicone mats Working with a sharp thin knife slice the logs into rounds that are 1 2 inch thick The rounds are likely to crack as you re cutting them don t be concerned just squeeze the bits back onto each cookie Arrange the rounds on the baking sheets leaving about one inch between them Bake the cookies one sheet at a time for 12 minutes they won t look done nor will they be firm but that s just the way they should be Transfer the baking sheet to a cooling rack and let the cookies rest until they are only just warm at which point you can serve them or let them reach room temperature Serving The cookies can be eaten when they are warm or at room temperature I prefer them at room temperature when the textural difference between the crumbly cookie and the chocolate bits is greatest and are best suited to cold milk or hot coffee Do ahead Packed airtight cookies will keep at room temperature for up to 3 days Deb note not a chance they can be frozen for up to 2 months They can also be frozen in log form for months and can be sliced and baked

programs And celebrity shills sporting milk mustaches tell us that milk is rich in proteins calcium and vitamins and very cool to boot They forget to tell you about the dangers lurking in that innocuous looking glass of white Once criticized only by naturopaths and vegans now the health effects of milk are being decried by many mainstream doctors The supposedly hip milk mustache is actually a creamy layer of mucus live bacteria and pus Former Chairman of Pediatrics at Johns Hopkins University Frank Oski M D even has a book called Don t Drink Your Milk which blames every second health problem kids suffer on hormone ridden commercial milk Sixty percent of ear infections in kids under six years of age are milk induced and milk consumption is the number one cause of iron deficiency anemia in infants today according to the American Association of Pediatrics But milk is also a racial issue Almost 90 percent of African Americans and most Latinos Asians and Southern Europeans lack the genes necessary to digest lactose the primary sugar in milk The milk industry s response is classic they have launched new campaigns arguing that non whites can digest milk if they take in small sips during the day There is a burgeoning industry worth 450 million a year churning out products designed to minimize lactose intolerance Lactose intolerance is the most common food allergy but to call it an allergy is to take a white centric view that trivializes the fact that most of the world s people are not biologically designed to digest milk Milk does no body good but for the vast majority of the world s people people of color it is a public health disaster No other animal drinks cow s milk not even calves once they are weaned The late Dr Benjamin Spock the U S s leading authority on child care spoke out against feeding cow s glue to children saying it can cause anemia allergies and diabetes and in the long term will set kids up for obesity and heart disease the number one cause of death in this country Most of milk s much vaunted protein is contained in casein which is also a raw material for commercial glue Undigested it simply sticks to the intestinal walls and blocks nutrient absorption The mainstream media and the government ignore the medical studies showing that milk is a serious health threat in part because people of color are the main victims The institutionalization of racism is highlighted by U S Department of Agriculture spokesperson Eilene Kennedy s statement on milk that the government s recommended food pyramid is intended for the majority of Americans It doesn t communicate to all Americans The USDA continues to require that school lunch programs include milk with every meal and recommend that we glug milk for calcium even though Harvard studies show an increase in osteoporosis and bone breakage in people who consume milk It says we should drink milk to prevent heart disease and is echoed by Larry King even though saturated fat constitutes 55 percent of milk solids The dairy lobby perpetrates lies to ensure its profits It benefits directly from the exaggerated support prices the government shells out for this health food The government pays over a billion dollars a year for surplus butter A General Accounting Office GAO study concluded that a reduction in the government price support system would have netted consumers savings of 10 4 billion from 1986 to 2001 And the USDA pays inflated prices to purchase dairy products for both the Women Infants and Children WIC and federal school lunch programs milking the taxpayers and actually getting them to pay for poisoning 26 million school kids The milk lobby has whipsawed its way into the highest echelons of power Staffers under Richard Nixon were indicted for accepting 300 000 from the dairy lobby for making milk part of the school lunch program Dr Robert Cohen of the Dairy Education Board a nonprofit organization dedicated to exposing the milk lobby contends that the dramatic 52 percent rise in asthma deaths among minority kids in New York coincided with the surplus milk cheese and butter pumped into them under the USDA s free school lunch and breakfast giveaway programs The incidence of asthma deaths may be even higher since asthma is not a reportable disease and asthma deaths are sometimes certified as cardiovascular disease There is also a direct link between milk consumption and prostate cancer among African Americans who have the highest incidence of this disease in the world A study in Cancer has shown that men who reported drinking three or more glasses of whole milk daily had a higher risk for prostate cancer than men who reported never drinking whole milk The controversial Bovine Growth Hormone BGH banned in most countries is pumped into U S milch cows to increase annual yield 50 000 pounds of milk per cow today compared to 2 000 pounds in 1959 Milk from cows treated with BGH is likely to contain pus from their udders since the hormone leads to mastitis or udder infection BGH use results in a tumor promoting chemical IGF I that has been implicated in an explosive increase of cancer of the colon smooth muscle and breast The antibiotics dairy farmers use to treat BGH caused infections in cows appear in their milk and greatly hasten human tolerance to most antibiotics a potentially life threatening

Protesters picketed New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani s planned milk promotion campaign with a photo of the mayor wearing a milk mustache over the caption Got Prostate Cancer Giuliani who like his father has prostate cancer dropped the campaign And doctors from the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine PCRM persuaded Washington D C Mayor Anthony Williams not to declare May 11 as Drink Chocolate Milk Day by presenting evidence that milk is harmful especially to people of color The PCRM composed of some of the leading doctors in the U S has campaigned extensively in the health and consumer press and led a successful legal effort in 1999 to make dairy products optional in the federal food guidelines The campaign was supported by a number of prominent civil rights organizations

"http://www.freep.com/article/20121020/FEATURES08/121020002/1025/features"	"1689"	"{""body"":""   The maker of Banana Boat sunscreen is recalling some half-million bottles of spray-on lotion after reports that a handful of people have caught on fire after applying the product and coming in contact with an open flame. Energizer Holdings said Friday that it is pulling 23 varieties of UltraMist sunscreen off store shelves due to the risk of the lotion igniting when exposed to fire. The recall includes aerosol products like UltraMist Sport, UltraMist Ultra Defense and UltraMist Kids. A company spokesman said there have been five reports of people suffering burns after using the sunscreen in the last year. Four burn cases were reported in the U.S. and one in Canada. More than 20 million units have been sold since UltraMist launched in 2010, the spokesman said. The problem appears to be caused by UltraMist's spray valve, which is over applying the product, Energizer said in a statement. As a result the lotion is taking longer to dry, which raises the flammability risk. \""If a consumer comes into contact with a flame or spark prior to complete drying of the product on the skin, there is a potential for the product to ignite,\"" the company said. UltraMist's label warns users: \""Keep away from sources of ignition  no smoking.\"" But dermatologists say most people don't read such labels. \""So many people put this on outside, while they're on their way to activities, so I just don't think people are aware of that,\"" said Michele Green, a dermatologist at New York's Lenox Hill Hospital. Green said aerosol sunscreens have become popular in recent years because they're faster and easier to apply than traditional creams. Doctors and burn experts said Friday the problem appears to be extremely rare. \""I've been doing this for 30 years and I've never seen or heard of this happening before,\"" said Darrel Rigel, professor of dermatology at New York University. Rigel pointed out that the flammable ingredients in aerosol  including alcohol  are common to many products, including hairspray and spray-on deodorants. \""I think you just have to use common sense and not be near an open fire when you put on aerosol anything,\"" said Rigel, a past president of the American Academy of Dermatology. Dan Dillard, executive director of the Burn Prevention Network, said the group was contacted earlier this year about two burns related to spray-on sunscreen. One case involved a man who was standing near a barbecue grill, the other involved a woman working with welding equipment. Both cases resulted in second and third degree burns. \""We've found no evidence of this happening before the incidents that came to our attention,\"" Dillard said. St. Louis-based Energizer Holdings said it has notified the Food and Drug Administration about the recall, which it undertook voluntarily. Consumers who purchased the products are being told not to use them. More information is available from the manufacturer at 1-800-SAFESUN.    health,freep.com,detroit,michigan,news,local news,headlines,stories,world news  there have been reports of people catching fire after applying some banana boat ultramist units.  there have been reports of people catching fire after applying some banana boat ultramist units.  there have been reports of people catching fire after applying some banana boat ultramist units.

doughnuts I would have an extremely difficult time choosing which was which I love sugar donuts and I never realized the tastes would be so similar to muffins but they are The texture of the sugar donut muffin is pillow soft on the inside and super moist It has a crispy sugar coating on the outside with a hint of nutmeg in every bite The sugared chocolate spiced muffin was similar in texture It looks like a muffin but tastes more like a chocolate spiced cake When you take a bite you instantly get the sweetness from the sugar and the nutmeg with a mild chocolate flavour but it s quickly replaced with heat from the cinnamon If you re looking for an alternative to the typical sweet chocolate muffin recipes this is it My kitchen looked like a doughnut shop last night The island was covered in muffins delicious donuts chocolate glaze and cinnamon sugar and just like a doughnut shop I was baking till the wee hours of the morning Before I knew it 4 00 am rolled around I guess that

people enjoy learning facts about this incredible organ in the human body Below you will find 100 facts about the brain including how it works how it develops what it controls how it affects sleep dreams and memory and more which may be helpful When you finish reading about these fun facts take this short brainpower quiz and see how much you learned about the human brain Physical Attributes These facts will teach you interesting bits of information about the physical make up of the human brain Weight The weight of the human brain is about 3 lbs Cerebrum The cerebrum is the largest part of the brain and makes up 85 of the brain s weight Skin Your skin weighs twice as much as your brain Gray matter The brain s gray matter is made up of neurons which gather and transmit signals White matter The white matter is made up of dendrites and axons which create the network by which neurons send their signals Gray and white Your brain is 60 white matter and 40 gray matter Water The brain is made up of about 75 water Neurons Your brain consists of about 100 billion neurons Synapses There are anywhere from 1 000 to 10 000 synapses for each neuron No pain There are no pain receptors in the brain so the brain can feel no pain Largest brain While an elephant s brain is physically larger than a human brain the human brain is 2 of total body weight compared to 0 15 of an elephant s brain meaning humans have the largest brain to body size Blood vessels There are 100 000 miles of blood vessels in the brain Fat The human brain is the fattest organ in the body and may consists of at least 60 fat The Developing Brain Starting from within the womb fetal brain development begins the amazing journey that leads to a well developed brain at birth that continues to grow for 18 more years Neurons Neurons develop at the rate of 250 000 neurons per minute during early pregnancy Size at birth At birth your brain was almost the same size as an adult brain and contained most of the brain cells for your whole life Newborn s growth A newborn baby s brain grows about three times its size in the first year Stopped growing Your brain stopped growing at age 18 Cerebral cortex The cerebral cortex grows thicker as you learn to use it Stimulation A stimulating environment for a child can make the difference between a 25 greater ability to learn or 25 less in an environment with little stimulation New neurons Humans continue to make new neurons throughout life in response to mental activity Read aloud Reading aloud and talking often to a young child promotes brain development Emotions The capacity for such emotions as joy happiness fear and shyness are already developed at birth The specific type of nurturing a child receives shapes how these emotions are developed First sense The first sense to develop while in utero is the sense of touch The lips and cheeks can experience touch at about 8 weeks and the rest of the body around 12 weeks Bilingual brains Children who learn two languages before the age of five alters the brain structure and adults have a much denser gray matter Child abuse and the brain Studies have shown that child abuse can inhibit development of the brain and can permanently affect brain development Brain Function From the invisible workings of the brain to more visible responses such as yawns or intelligence find out how the brain functions with these facts Oxygen Your brain uses 20 of the total oxygen in your body Blood As with oxygen your brain uses 20 of the blood circulating in your body Unconsciousness If your brain loses blood for 8 to 10 seconds you will lose consciousness Speed Information can be processed as slowly as 0 5 meters sec or as fast as 120 meters sec about 268 miles hr Wattage While awake your brain generates between 10 and 23 watts of power or enough energy to power a light bulb Yawns It is thought that a yawn works to send more oxygen to the brain therefore working to cool it down and wake it up Neocortex The neocortex makes up about 76 of the human brain and is responsible for language and consciousness The human neocortex is much larger than in animals 10 The old adage of humans only using 10 of their brain is not true Every part of the brain has a known function Brain death The brain can live for 4 to 6 minutes without oxygen and then it begins to die No oxygen for 5 to 10 minutes will result in permanent brain damage Highest temperature The next time you get a fever keep in mind that the highest human body temperature ever recorded was 115 7 degrees and the man survived Stress Excessive stress has shown to alter brain cells brain structure and brain function Love hormones and autism Oxytocin one of the hormones responsible for triggering feelings of love in the brain has shown some benefits to helping control repetitive behaviors in those with autism Food and intelligence A study of one million students in New York showed that students who ate lunches that did not include artificial flavors preservatives and dyes did 14 better on IQ tests than students who ate lunches with these additives Seafood In the March 2003 edition of Discover magazine a report describes how people in a 7 year study who ate seafood at least one time every week had a 30 lower occurrence of dementia Psychology of the Brain From tickling to tasting to decision making find out how the

the ears For years medical professionals believed that tinnitus was due to a function within the mechanics of the ear but newer evidence shows that it is actually a function of the brain Pain and gender Scientists have discovered that men and women s brains react differently to pain which explains why they may perceive or discuss pain differently Supertasters There is a class of people known as supertasters who not only have more taste buds on the tongue but whose brain is more sensitive to the tastes of foods and drinks In fact they can detect some flavors that others cannot Cold Some people are much more sensitive to cold and actually feel pain associated with cold Research as shown that the reason is due to certain channels that send cold information to the brain Decision making Women tend to take longer to make a decision but are more likely to stick with the decision compared to men who are more likely to change their mind after making a decision Exercise Some studies indicate that while some people are naturally more active others are naturally more inactive which may explain why getting out and exercising is more difficult for some Boredom Boredom is brought on by a lack of change of stimulation is largely a function of perception and is connected to the innate curiosity found in humans Physical illness The connection between body and mind is a strong one

Bread Photo Tutorial "",""body"":""I may have mentioned no knead bread once or twice before My method has roots in the NYT The Minimalist recipe but I ve eliminated several steps over time and am still happy with the results This recipe is wonderful for people short on time or spoons It is a high water low yeast long rise recipe where time does the work of developing the gluten instead of your hands and muscles You do need a good cooking vessel and the strength to lift it in and out of the oven but otherwise the ingredient equipment and activity needs are fairly minimal My breadmaker languishes in the cupboard these days only dragged out if we want bread the same day or to make jam The texture is lovely a little bit sourdough a little bit Italian a little bit ciabatta You can adjust the texture and taste in a few ways this is what I ve settled on as my basic recipe but do please play with it I ve never made an effort to do this with any non wheat flours and I feel that this particular recipe is pretty much dependent on gluten but others have tried and tried and tried and some have made edible things People keep asking how I make it but as I don t measure particularly much and it s all done by feel and experience now I tend to wave my hands pointlessly in the air and generally fail at getting across how exactly I make this stuff So here s a photo tutorial Very image heavy below the cut I m sorry I haven t alt tagged and title tagged all the gazillion photos but I do describe the action in the post text Ingredients And Equipment You will need About three cups of flour I use one third wholemeal flour two thirds organic baker s flour high gluten I have made this before with regular plain flour and it still works fine Add more wholemeal if you like but you ll find your rise is much less enthusiastic About two teaspoons of salt About two cups of water About a third to a half a teaspoon of instant yeast A large bowl A mixing spoon A lidded cooking vessel that can take a very high heat Oven gauntlets A clean tea towel Optional ingredients include seeds poppy sesame caraway sunflower nigella whatever else you like orange juice olive oil herbs nuts etc Also handy A dough scraper but you can use a spoon if you really want to I use these gorgeous gauntlets They are very heavy duty and have silicone grips for extra grippiness and extra heat resistance This pot will be HOT And heavy This is my bread pot It s an oval Le Creuset dutch oven Be sure to cover the handle liberally with aluminium foil if you don t it will smoke and burn and smell really really bad Other people have used lidded Pyrex risky some say yes some say no various heatproof lidded ceramic pots and so on I can t emphasis this too much your oven will be HOT Make sure your cooking vessel can take it You also want something with a good thermal mass not a thin metal pan I recommend cast iron either enamelled or not Making the dough First step Measure out your flour I use whatever coffee cup comes to hand and I throw in around one cup of wholemeal flour and two cups of white I don t shake or level or anything else fancy I just scoop and throw You ll adjust the texture in the water step Make sure your bowl is quite a bit bigger than your mix You will get a lot of rising later maybe double or triple the size of the stuff Or sometimes more Yeast About a third of a teaspoon for a long rise overnight you can speed up the rise a bit by adding more yeast and mixing with warm water but you will sacrifice texture and taste if you do this I use a table teaspoon not a measuring spoon Salt Two heaped teaspoons Yes it needs salt I left it out once and BLEAGH Also the salt helps preserve the bread You can get all fancy and use expensive salt if you want I don t bother Mix up those dry ingredients You can add some poppy seeds or other bits n pieces now Now for the wet stuff You can optionally add around a capful or two of orange juice to make the yeasties extra happy Don t worry about it if you don t have this handy You can also add olive oil I do around 20 30 seconds of this dribbler which I think is something like a tablespoon or a dessertspoon or something in this order of magnitude It s no big deal if you leave this out but don t leave out the salt Really Top that cup up with tap water Chuck it in Grab another cup of tap water but don t put all of this in Put maybe a half or mmmaybe two thirds depending on how heapy you did the flour cups back at the start Mix it on up This is the part that I find hard to explain You need to adjust that water amount to get the texture right It should be wet too wet to tip out and knead but not as wet as cake batter It shouldn t look sort of dusty floury lThere still should be quite a bit of resistance to stirring not just la la la stir stir stir like you do when making a cake If you can scoop up a spoonful and it drops off the spoon really easily like this it s too wet When it s right it will strand a lot when you try to lift up a spoonful like this It will reluctantly drop off the spoon but strandily So go on adjusting that water level you may sometimes need to shake in a little more flour until it s just right You will get a feel for this over time Letting it rise Grab a clean tea towel wet it thoroughly squeeze it out don t wring and drape that over the bowl Some people cover with a lid or plastic wrap but I wasn t happy with the results when I did that I prefer this method Go ahead and leave this bowl somewhere non freezing overnight How long How long is a piece of string I usually mix it up in the evening and cook it around the middle of the day or in the afternoon the next day I ve left it 14 hours before I ve left it 24 Longer rises can have less yeast and a cooler spot shorter rises want a little more yeast and a warmer spot and if you re in a big hurry use tepidly warmish water to mix it up instead of taking it from the cold tap If it hasn t risen to your satisfaction you can pop it in an oven with only the light on for a while or set it on a heat pad or heated wheat bag Here s one I prepared earlier It isn t the hugest rise ever but it s just fine I can see lots of little bubbles over the surface which haven t shown up well in the picture Sometimes you ll see some big bubbles making themselves known I m confident this is going to be good there s a lovely yeasty smell Cooking Here s the inside of my pot You can see that it s very very well seasoned This pot has seen a lot of loaves of bread I don t use it for anything else these days and it never sees detergent just a wipe out after use If your pot isn t well seasoned I do recommend a spray or a smear of olive oil Some of my earlier batches stuck and that was all kinds of no fun at all Set your oven to 230 240 degrees For the Luddites that s around 445 465 Pop your pot in there making sure any Bakelite is well covered And preheat the oven and pot and lid for about 20 minutes When that pot is lovely and hot take it out carefully and dump that dough on in Try to get it quickly peeled out and dumped in one piece with as little stretching and separating and dropping and fiddling as you can I use a dough scraper to scoop and place In this picture I ve held the bowl up to show you the stranding all that gluten developed with no kneading The power of microbeasties This is how it should look now Don t stand around looking at it for too long Put on some seeds if you like I ve used sesame Lid on and put it in the oven for 20 minutes This recipe is so easy you don t even have to re set your timer to a different number At the twenty minute mark take the lid off I ve taken the pot out for the photo but usually I just reach in and grab the lid out for minimal heat loss Salivate now If your oven heats a little unevenly this might also be a good time to spin the pot around 180 degrees Another twenty minutes The Bread This is your finished product In the pot and out of it This is the underside And here it is cooling on the rack If you want a chewy crust and very moist crumb you can wrap it in a tea towel at this stage For a crustier crust leave it out in the open If you prefer something in between you can wrap it for a while and then unwrap it Look at this baby Do you love it IMPORTANT Do not cut it until it s cooled right down Yes I know how tempting it is Just wait It s worth it Tra la Serve However you like Spread it with butter Drizzle it with olive oil Try cream cheese Peanut butter Pesto Pate Make bruschetta Make garlic bread When the loaf is down to the last quarter and getting a tad stale slice the crusts off and use the interior to make stuffing for poultry I just cut it into cubes no fiddefaddling or toasting So to recap the numbers Three cups of flour two teaspoons of salt a third of a teaspoon of yeast but no one ll care if you put in a half Optional stuff OJ EVOO seeds etc Leave it for 18 hours or whatever Preheat to hot for 20 cook for 20 lid on 20 lid off Related Posts related posts: a good bread day by lauredhel soapmaking and breadmaking &#8211; will i be in demand when the pandemic comes? by lauredhel wednesday

situation Dr Mueller recommends completely removing caffeine from your diet I really think that caffeine is a big big problem with frequent headaches she said The problem comes in if you take caffeine every day If you miss one day of caffeine infusion you can set off a headache Although the doctor warns things usually will get worse before they get better Weaning yourself off the cup of joe over a two to three week time frame can help ease the transition to a caffeine free life Controlling the painWhen patients come in for a visit he goes through four main steps to evaluate how to control the pain First he looks into what the patient takes when he or she has a migraine attack After that he looks into prevention techniques and medications He then focuses on the mind planning for a migraine recognizing triggers learning to relax and arranging a proper sleep schedule His final step is to look directly at helping the body focusing on potential neck issues food consumption and exercise Exercise has shown to be effective he said Sometimes general practitioners downgrade migraines as simple headaches when according to Dr Young if they re seeking medical advice it s probably not a tension headache Sinus headache is largely a myth he said They re treating migraines as sinus headaches and people aren t getting the proper diagnosis Another issue comes into play when sufferers rely too heavily on over the counter medications such as Tylenol Advil or Excedrin While Excedrin is the best option according to Dr Young consuming too much in a short period of time can cause even more problems in the long run A medical overuse headache occurs when people take too many medications too often and actually change the pattern of the headaches thus making them worse It s a huge public health problem he said Drug free alternativesFor those looking to avoid medications to relieve head pain there are other options but they are not foolproof Vitamin B2 magnesium Feverfew and butterbur root all are alternative products that can sometimes help according to Dr Mueller Get enough sleep Try to maintain the same schedule every day she added Don t skip meals wake up at the same time in each morning and look out for food triggers There are plenty of reasons why a headache has yet to go away according to Dr Mueller They come in with a laundry list of what they ve taken before she said Sometimes the patient wasn t on the pill long enough Nobody maybe got them up to a high enough dose If they re still drinking their pot of coffee and take it the daily medicine we treat with probably is not going to work The right balanceMedication and lifestyle adjustments may need to happen more than once You re constantly adjusting she said Patients biochemistry do change in time Although it can be a rough long slippery slope of life altering flexibility the result of being migraine or headache free should never disappear from the horizon According to Dr Mueller Even if they haven t found relief in the past I would keep trying Try to find someone that specifically deals with headaches On the Web www jefferson edu headache Thomas Jefferson University s Headache Center offers general information about migraines a searchable directory of clinical and non clinical trials and related websites www americanheadachesociety org American Headache Society has details for patients tools to help manage pain and helpful journal articles www headaches org National Headache Foundation is the world s largest voluntary organization for headache sufferers according to their website They provide information to help battle head pain blogs poetry and a physician finder many factors can prompt migraines including aged cheese, nitrates, caffeine, alcohol, stress, and even the letdown after a stressful day. many factors can prompt migraines including aged cheese, nitrates, caffeine, alcohol, stress, and even the letdown after a stressful day."",""url"":""yourlife usatoday health

"http://www.newsweek.com/id/43884/output/print"	"8329"	"{""title"":""Money Happiness Newsweek money & happiness - newsweek"",""body"":""All in all it was probably a mistake to look for the answer to the eternal question Does money buy happiness from people who practice what s called the dismal science For when economists tackled the question they started from the observation that when people put something up for sale they try to get as much for it as they can and when people buy something they try to pay as little for it as they can Both sides in the transaction the economists noticed are therefore behaving as if they would be more satisfied happier dare we say if they wound up receiving more money the seller or holding on to more money the buyer Hence more money must be better than less and the only way more of something can be better than less of it is if it brings you greater contentment The economists conclusion the more money you have the happier you must be Depressed debutantes suicidal CEOs miserable magnates and other unhappy rich folks aren t the only ones giving the lie to this Psychologists have spent decades studying the relation between wealth and happiness writes Harvard University psychologist Daniel Gilbert in his best selling Stumbling on Happiness and they have generally concluded that wealth increases human happiness when it lifts people out of abject poverty and into the middle class but that it does little to increase happiness thereafter That flies in the face of intuition not to mention economic theory According to standard economics the most important commodity you can buy with additional wealth is choice If you have 20 in your pocket you can decide between steak and peanut butter for dinner but if you have only 1 you d better hope you already have a jar of jelly at home Additional wealth also lets you satisfy additional needs and wants and the more of those you satisfy the happier you are supposed to be The trouble is choice is not all it s cracked up to be Studies show that people like selecting from among maybe half a dozen kinds of pasta at the grocery store but find 27 choices overwhelming leaving them chronically on edge that they could have chosen a better one than they did And wants which are nice to be able to afford have a bad habit of becoming needs iPod anyone of which an advertising and media saturated culture create endless numbers Satisfying needs brings less emotional well being than satisfying wants The nonlinear nature of how much happiness money can buy lots more happiness when it moves you out of penury and into middle class comfort hardly any more when it lifts you from millionaire to decamillionaire comes through clearly in global surveys that ask people how content they feel with their lives In a typical survey people are asked to rank their sense of well being or happiness on a scale of 1 to 7 where 1 means not at all satisfied with my life and 7 means completely satisfied Of the American multimillionaires who responded the average happiness score was 5 8 Homeless people in Calcutta came in at 2 9 But before you assume that money does buy happiness after all consider who else rated themselves around 5 8 the Inuit of northern Greenland who do not exactly lead a life of luxury and the cattle herding Masai of Kenya whose dung huts have no electricity or running water And proving Gilbert s point about money buying happiness only when it lifts you out of abject poverty slum dwellers in Calcutta one economic rung above the homeless rate themselves at 4 6 Studies tracking changes in a population s reported level of happiness over time have also dealt a death blow to the money buys happiness claim Since World War II the gross domestic product per capita has tripled in the United States But people s sense of well being as measured by surveys asking some variation of Overall how satisfied are you with your life has barely budged Japan has had an even more meteoric rise in GDP per capita since its postwar misery but measures of national happiness have been flat as they have also been in Western Europe during its long postwar boom according to social psychologist Ruut Veenhoven of Erasmus University in Rotterdam A 2004 analysis of more than 150 studies on wealth and happiness concluded that economic indicators have glaring shortcomings as approximations of well being across nations wrote Ed Diener of the University of Illinois Urbana Champaign and Martin E P Seligman of the University of Pennsylvania Although economic output has risen steeply over the past decades there has been no rise in life satisfaction and there has been a substantial increase in depression and distrust That s partly because in an expanding economy in which former luxuries such as washing machines become necessities the newly affluent don t feel the same joy in having a machine do the laundry that their grandparents suddenly freed from washboards did They just take the Maytag for granted Americans who earn 50 000 per year are much happier than those who earn 10 000 per year writes Gilbert but Americans who earn 5 million per year are not much happier than those who earn 100 000 per year Another reason is that an expanding paycheck especially in an expanding economy produces expanding aspirations and a sense that there is always one more cool thing out there that you absolutely have to have Economic success falls short as a measure of well being in part because materialism can negatively influence well being Diener and Seligman conclude If money doesn t buy happiness what does Grandma was right when she told you to value health and friends not money and stuff Or as Diener and Seligman put it once your basic needs are met differences in well being are less frequently due to income and are more frequently due to factors such as social relationships and enjoyment at work Other researchers add fulfillment a sense that life has meaning belonging to civic and other groups and living in a democracy that respects individual rights and the rule of law If a nation wants to increase its population s sense of well being says Veenhoven it should make less investment in economic growth and more in policies that promote good governance liberties democracy trust and public safety Curiously although money doesn t buy happiness happiness can buy money Young people who describe themselves as happy typically earn higher incomes years later than those who said they were unhappy It seems that a sense of well being can make you more productive and more likely to show initiative and other traits that lead to a higher income Contented people are also more likely to marry and stay married as well as to be healthy both of which increase happiness If more money doesn t buy more happiness then the behavior of most Americans looks downright insane as we work harder and longer decade after decade to fatten our W 2s But what is insane for an individual is crucial for a national economy that is ever more growth and consumption Gilbert again Economies can blossom and grow only if people are deluded into believing that the production of wealth will make them happy Economies thrive when individuals strive but because individuals will strive only for their own happiness it is essential that they mistakenly believe that producing and consuming are routes to personal well being In other words if you want to do your part for your country s economy forget all of the above about money not buying happiness health, usd, economic growth,

has transformed his body and his life Over 18 months the teenager originally from Georgia lost half of his bodyweight turning his love of gaming into a motivational tool Chronicling his battle against childhood obesity Taylor last year launched a book Cutting Myself in Half 150 Pounds Lost One Byte at a Time aiming to set other children on the course to healthier lifestyles and away from obesity Halved weight Taylor LeBaron 18 has written a book about his extraordinary weight loss The teenager this week told CNN that at school he was targeted because of is size People just put me down for no real reason other then my weight issue The turning point came when Taylor had the shock of his life by standing on some weighing scales at age 14 297lb and I m 14 years old and I m alone in this room and I m like Oh my goodness I m not even an adult and I weigh nearly 300lbs He blames his massive weight at the time to a combination of factors A lack of physical exercise and physical activity I had a lifestyle choice of eating whenever whatever and however much of it as I want and I knew from that moment on that I gotta do something to take back my life Morbidly obese Taylor went from 297lbs to 147lbs shedding half of his body weight Challenge Taylor devised an extreme weight loss programme that he turned into a game mimicking the video games he loves As Taylor had been overweight since a very young age that meant making some massive and fundamental changes across his whole life His lifestyle plan starting immediately saw him drop junk food count calories and get more active including taking long walks and playing fewer sedentary video games I developed a plan that s based on videogame strategies the prize is a whole new lifestyle It wasn t an easy start his first time at the gym saw him ride an exercise bike for nine minutes and 48 seconds before the machine signalled a warning that kicked the teenage off But to help him along the way Taylor also devised a motivational game based on the video games he loved I developed a plan that s based on videogame strategies which I call the Ultimate Fitness Game because the prize is a whole new lifestyle Once I started playing UFG I never looked back In the next 18 months my weight dropped from 297 to 147 and it s the weight I ve maintained ever since Work out The Georgia native joined a gym to push his weight loss to the next level He now maintains a weight of less than 150lbs I ll be 19 next month and now if I stepped on the scale and saw my once dream weight of 190 I d panic because I d be more than 40 pounds over my normal weight the teen writes on the news site The result is Taylor s diet plan that he says is designed with teenagers lifestyles in mind and is realistic and achievable I think it s much easier to keep the weight off if you think of it as a lifestyle change not a diet Diet implies it s temporary He says his transformed life has opened up previously unimaginable opportunities to him As dreams came true I discovered bigger dreams I d never imagined I was selected as one of ten teens to carry the torch in the 2010 Winter Olympics he writes on CNN com Opportunity The teen says his dreams are coming true thanks to his new lifestyle He was selected as a torch bearer for the 2010 Olympics The criteria for the national contest were academics fitness community service and environmental concern Before getting fit I would have qualified in every area but one Taylor a freshman studying economics at Washington College in Chestertown Maryland is now a motivational speaker My goal is to be able

stress college degree.com | 10 weirdest ways that people manage stress"",""body"":""Published on Wednesday April 13th 2011 Stress is a normal human reaction to life s pressures and challenges We spend most of our lives trying to figure out the best ways to avoid stress and keep it under control with exercise sleep a balanced diet and deep breathing exercises But when those traditional stress relievers no longer work people will find alternative and often unhealthy methods to cope with their stress Here are the 10 weirdest ways that people manage stress Gambling Gambling may seem like a weird way to handle stress but many people find comfort in playing against the odds Those who have an insatiable urge to gamble despite potentially negative consequences are often classified as gambling addicts Gambling provides an adrenaline rush and sense of euphoria when you win therefore someone who is depressed or burdened by a lot of stress might find solace in gambling Self Injury Cutting Some people relieve stress by deliberately hurting themselves This self induced pain is often done by cutting or burning the skin and engaging in dangerous activities People who injure themselves aren t trying to commit suicide but it could be fatal if the injuries are serious enough Self injury is often accompanied by several mental illnesses such as depression bipolar disorder and eating disorders No matter the circumstance deliberately harming oneself is an unhealthy way to cope with stress emotional pain and anger Hoarding Hoarding is a symptom of obsessive compulsive disorder OCD in which individuals collect an excessive amount of items that are generally useless or of little value Hoarding can also involve collecting animals For many individuals hoarding things is a way to relieve stress and overcome other issues Hoarders feel safe and secure when they have their belongings nearby yet it becomes an additional source of stress when it starts to interfere with their safety health and social life Hair Pulling Hair pulling also known as trichotillomania is a disorder that causes people to excessively pull out their hair This irresistible urge to pluck out hair from the scalp eyebrows eyelashes and other parts of the body can be a form of stress relief for certain individuals Although the cause of trichotillomania is not clear it s often associated with genetic and environmental factors or chemical imbalances This disorder is not a normal way of managing stress and should not be taken lightly Vomiting Some people feel a sense of relief to vomit when they re stressed Whether the stress has been brought on by nerves an eating disorder or another form of pressure forcing yourself to vomit is not a healthy way of coping with stress Those who engage in self induced vomiting may feel temporary relief but this disordered behavior may lead to more sever eating disorders malnutrition extreme weight loss and other serious health problems Tattoos Getting tattoos is another odd way that people manage stress Whether it s the touch of the needle immense pain or increase of endorphins to the brain the experience of getting tattoos can be very soothing to stressed individuals Tattooing may also be a less obvious form of self mutilation which can be a cause for concern Overworking It s not uncommon for stressed individuals to try to manage their stress by increasing their workload and working overtime Many people think they can manage their stress and that things will get easier if they just work longer and harder than normal However overworked people may end up making more mistakes and increasing their stress levels because they haven t allowed themselves to relax and get an adequate amount of rest needed to be efficient throughout the day Not Dealing With It at All Many people manage their stress by not dealing with it at all These people turn a blind eye when they are faced with something stressful and put their problems on the back burner hoping their issues will disappear or resolve themselves Others may shut down completely and go into a catatonic state Ignoring stress will only make it worse and could lead to further problems Spending Compulsive shopping and spending is another weird way people manage their stress Treating yourself to a nice bracelet or new pair of shoes may seem innocent enough but this compulsive desire to regularly spend money that you probably don t have can become a very serious problem Compulsive shoppers face several negative consequences such as extreme debt strained relationships ruined credit history anxiety and additional stress Physically Fighting Today more and more people cope with their stress by physically fighting Exercising is simply not enough for these adrenaline junkies who need to let out their aggression on someone else or feel the pain of being hit These people may be hotheads who are always picking fights or an unsuspecting coworker who s a member of an underground fight club No matter their preference fighting is not a normal or healthy way of managing your stress Not only are you inflicting injury on someone else but you too could get severely hurt when traditional stress relievers no longer work, people will find alternative and often unhealthy methods to cope with their stress. when traditional stress relievers no longer work,

2010 6 16 AM ETFORTUNE Back in the day the knock on Hollywood was that it produced too many two dimensional characters Now moviegoers are beginning to grumble about paying up to see them in the third dimension as well While premium pricing for 3 D movie tickets has lined studio pockets over the last few years it hasn t translated into throngs of new moviegoers at the theater Movie admissions have been in a tailspin for more than a decade and despite a bump in 2009 new data shows the public is cooling to the offerings at their local theater yet again Hollywood com s box office survey shows attendance down by 2 2 through July 18th of this year when compared with 2009 Memorial Day weekend traditionally the busiest four days of the year drew the smallest audience in 17 years A river of schlocky films certainly doesn t help boost attendance but a river of overpriced 3 D schlock may actually be steepening the decline A July survey of more than 2 000 moviegoers by BTIG LLC a broker dealer firm found increasing chafe at the high cost of 3 D films which tend to carry around a 4 surcharge That brings a 9 children s ticket to see say Despicable Me up to 13 in New York City a despicable premium for a product that often provides little additional value to the movie going experience and may even detract from it Movie studios have never really risked broad consumer revolt against theatergoing because ticket prices have remained relatively low Sure theater attendance has suffered from a few slings and arrows including the rise of the DVD and the increasing ease of online downloads But the rollout of improved 3 D technology again gave the multiplex an edge because the viewing experience could not be replicated at home Not worth the priceThe drastic climb in 3 D pricing now threatens the first glimmer of a profit rebound the studios have seen in years testing the studio s new normal and their belief that 3 D is recession proof To see a 4 premium on 3 D pricing is a pretty gigantic move for pricing says Richard Greenfield BTIG s media analyst Despite the staggering success of some blockbuster films attendance is down year to date That is clearly not a good sign The Last Airbender M Night Shyamalan s epic flop at the box office has become something of a poster child for all the expensive over hyped promise of 3 D technology Roger Ebert who recently called Hollywood s rush to 3 D every film suicidal and described 3 D pricing as a form of extortion for parents saved a special dose of venom for the 3 D d Airbender calling it an agonizing experience in every category I can think of and others still waiting to be invented The Wall Street Journal s Joe Morgenstern was equally uncharitable comparing Airbender to a form of Chinese water torture While the film appeared to be no great shakes even in two dimensions what unified most reviewers and viewers in protest was the extra mangling it took in 3 D As Ebert put it the process turned Airbender into the drabbest darkest dingiest movie he d seen in years and hammered a nail in the coffin of low rent 3 D The problem with 3 D films is not just the high price of admission to see them The technology process can make films noticeably darker and washed out as if the projector lens were smeared with Vaseline The 3 D process requires a scene to be separated into an image for each eye making light levels about half that of 2 D films Asked about his decision to keep his critically acclaimed movie Inception within the same old two dimensions director Chris Nolan recently explained to an audience at the Hero Complex Film Festival that the quality of the technology was just not there yet saying that he finds the dimness of the image extremely alienating If price and quality concerns didn t spell enough trouble for the 3 D movement Consumer Reports recently wrote how the brain s attempt to make sense of such 3 D images can cause headaches and eye strain in people with certain vision problems That s not exactly what a parent wants to hear while being dragged into yet another 3 D showing of Toy Story 3 The 2 D option is risingStudios have generally brushed off concerns that they are killing their latest cash cow While Disney DIS Fortune 500 CEO Bob Iger recently voiced concern over the sheer number of 3 D releases Universal distribution president Nikki Rocco told The Hollywood Reporter in his most abstruse studio speak that there remains considerable incremental gross advantage to both distributors and exhibitors in going with 3 D As Hollywood com s box office stats show despite declining movie consumption this year studios are still making out like bandits with high 3 D ticket prices helping to wrangle a 4 hike in running gross receipts But the revenue increase isn t a ringing endorsement of the technology by consumers In fact there is increasing evidence that they are not following the studios down the latest generational installment of the 3 D rabbit hole one most notably separated from earlier attempts in the 1950s 1960s and 1980s by a lack of colorful cardboard glasses or a previous skew towards horror exploitation and soft core porn though now all of that bounty appears on the way The crush of 3 D movies being offered this summer has whittled down the number of 3 D screens available for any single movie release Since big movies require big releases more 2 D screens are being used providing people with the option to see the films in the regular format When given the choice now many are choosing to forego an expensive trip to an often gimmicky third dimension While 3 D tickets accounted for 82 of the box office revenue for Avatar when it was released in December Universal s July 9th opening of Despicable Me took in an estimated 45 of its revenue from 3 D screens It follows a pretty steady decline seen by other hot 3 D releases from Toy Story 3 and How to Train Your Dragon to Tim Burton s remake of Alice in Wonderland Most interesting according to Greenfield is that in some cases movies with a wider release on 3 D screens are doing worse in terms of 3 D revenue than those that had more limited 3 D screen penetration Shrek Forever After for instance brought in a smaller percentage of revenue from 3 D screens than How to Train a Dragon despite being released on about 200 more 3 D screens A greater percentage of consumers simply opted to see the film in 2 D he wrote in a May post on BTIG s blog adding The last thing the industry needs is consumers starting to believe that 3 D is simply not worth it With Jackass 3 D on the way Ebert may be more prescient with that hammer swing than even he could see it was going to capture audiences and help save hollywood, but 3-d is already showing signs

play and work every day some Robert Fulghum Editor s note This is a guest post from Anastasiya Goers of Balance In Me Do you sometimes wonder whether your life is in balance It is easy to know if you lead a balanced life because if you do then you enjoy every moment and every second you can cope with any difficulties you can be happy without any reason to be happy you can be yourself and love the person you are Today the world constantly tries to throw you out of balance and sometimes no matter what you do you still feel like your life is going in the wrong direction I know I feel this way sometimes Balanced living might seem like one of those theoretical terms that nobody can put into practice but in fact there is nothing simpler than living a balanced life It might take some work at first but once you get in the flow and discover the simple ways to steer your life in your desired direction you will feel empowered You will be inspired and energized by every day of your life Your life will be full of amazing adventures and events that will make every day memorable You won t be wasting your life anymore or spending gloomy hours contemplating about the misfortunes that might have happened on your way Does balanced living mean that your life will be full of only positive people and events that will bring you happiness every moment of your life Not at all Balanced living is when you can always offset any negative events in your life with positive ones It is also when you can see the light at the end of the tunnel Balanced living is when you are happy working and playing equally If you picture happiness and everything great in your life as a diamond then any negative things that may happen are just the setting that makes this diamond shine only brighter If you want to live a balanced life then there are 5 essential habits that you need to develop Awareness and mindfulness Awareness is the key to balanced living because it lets you see every moment of your life and appreciate it A mindful person lives in the present and does not get obsessed with the future or the past It s important to plan for the future and learn from your mistakes in the past but it is even more important to appreciate who you are right now and find joy in this state When you are aware of this moment you are calm and you do not make any decisions that you might regret later When you are mindful you are in balance with the universe Appreciation of your body By appreciation I mean taking care of your body If you are grateful for the very first gift that you received in your life your body then you must take care of it It means making healthy choices in life exercising and being generally active eating a balanced and healthy diet letting your body rest when it s tired and pampering it every once in a while Your body is the tool that lets you experience so many wonderful moments in life and you need to do your best when taking care of it Clearly balanced living is not possible without a balanced body Creativity Every day we face a lot of challenges and choices in life Some of these challenges might be easy while others will be more difficult If you approach each of your challenges with creativity then your life will be filled with adventures Conversely if you turn off your creativity then your life will turn into torture Creativity is a wonderful tool that lets us turn our dreams into reality turn play into work and work into play and enjoy life even when it seems empty Creative people are the ones who can make the exquisite setting for the diamond of their life Patience With patience we can overcome almost anything whilst without it we can ruin almost anything Patience can help us turn our dreams into reality losing weight starting a business or blog It can help us be better parents spouses friends and even strangers sometimes a smile from an understanding stranger can make the biggest difference when you are having a bad day If you are patient you do not have to worry about the minutes spent in traffic or in the line at the grocery store With patience you can see results in all your endeavors and you do not have to spend the precious time of your life getting mad or infuriated Patience leads to mindfulness and mindfulness brings you in balance Simplicity Simplicity is probably the most important part of life balance When you build your life around simplicity you reduce the number of out of balance things that can disrupt your happy living In balance everything is simple There are two opposites like black and white and you just have to pick something in the middle Simplify you work schedule so that you do not have to think about a hundred things at the same time Simplify your relationships by connecting with people you truly care about and getting rid of the ones you don t Simplify your diet by choosing simple healthy ingredients that are part of balanced nutrition Simplify your social media exposure and enjoy living life and getting things done rather than wasting time online Simplicity makes life balance simple These habits have been my lifeline for many years and I cannot imagine a balanced and happy life without them Living in balance is easy and very rewarding because your life becomes the one of joy happiness and serenity If you put some time and effort into turning your life into a balanced direction then you too will live a truly Zen life Read more from Anastasiya at Balance In Me subscribe to her feed and keep your life in balance "",""url"":""zenhabits

fireplace so smores are a treat that I do not get to enjoy often enough They are such a winning flavor combination ooey gooey creamy marshmallows crunchy graham crackers and of course the delicious melty chocolate So if this girl wants smores she has to improvise a bit and whip them up in the oven I think I have found one heck of a great way to do just that Smores Pops Here s what you need for your indoor smores pops Pretty simple graham crackers marshmallows and chocolate You can also use graham cracker crumbs or sprinkles if you like There is really no scientific formula and you could use miniature marshmallows big marshmallows homemade marshmallows heck you can even use marshmallow fluff Have fun and use what you have Prepare your work area with some wax paper Because I was using full size marshmallows I decided to cut them in half You could do this with a knife kitchen shears a pizza cutter or you could probably even just tear them apart I went with the pizza cutter route A bit sticky but it got the job done After cutting your marshmallows you will want to sit them on your graham crackers I used one large marshmallow per smore You could use more it s really up to your personal taste You can heat your marshmallows two different ways microwave or oven While I love the roasted tops of the marshmallows from the oven honestly for the smore pops I think the microwave works better It makes the marshmallows sticky enough on both sides so that they bind to the graham crackers nicely If you use the microwave it only takes a few seconds literally The marshmallows above were in the microwave less than five seconds Those babies puff up FAST If you put the marshmallows in the oven as shown above without the top graham cracker on them you will have to work a bit more to get the top graham cracker to stay in place I achieved this by smooshing the gooey marshmallow around the sides Sometimes you just gotta do what you gotta do I m thinking that if you put the top marshmallow on before putting it in the oven the grahams will stay put though you will lose a bit of the crunchy cooked marshmallow taste I baked this tray of marshmallows for about 2 3 minutes at 425 degrees After they come out of the oven or microwave you will want to get the top graham crackers onto the marshmallows quickly You will have some ooze out the sides but that s okay The entire thing is going to be covered in chocolate so neatness really isn t a concern After putting the tops on you can slip your sticks into the marshmallows You can skip this part if you don t want to go the pop route After putting the graham cracker tops on and inserting the sticks you will want to let these set up for a bit An hour is enough time you just want the marshmallows to firm back up a bit Once the marshmallows are set up you can melt your chocolate Follow the directions on your package of chocolate You will want to make sure the melted chocolate cools a little bit before dipping otherwise you ll have a gooey mess But a delicious one I don t actually dip mine as I never have that much chocolate I use a small bowl and do a combo of dipping in chocolate and spooning on the chocolate Make sure to tap tap tap to get the excess drippy chocolate off Not that excess chocolate is ever a bad thing but it can be quite a mess After dipping in chocolate you can sprinkle the tops with graham cracker crumbs graham cracker chunks chocolate chips sprinkles or whatever else your little heart desires I sit mine on wax paper and let the chocolate set for an hour or so The time for the chocolate to set will vary based on the chocolate you use how hot it is the weather and possibly your astrological sign Okay maybe not that last one After that you are ready to ENJOY These are crazy good plain and simple Yum Smores on a stick Smores pops One thing that could make these even more outrageous would be to add in chocolate to the center of the smore I m going to have to give that a try next time I make them Without a stick Still JUST as tasty When I leave out the stick I do not completely cover them in chocolate Mainly because I don t want to get my hands all covered in chocolate I have a weird OCD issue with that I m a big fan of nice clean hands but that s another story And if you have the willpower to not devour them all in one sitting and can manage to give some away simply adding a cellophane bag and some ribbon will create a cute gift or favor Quick delicious and no campfire required However If you prefer you can sit around and sing kum ba yah and pretend you have that campfire part I m pretty much satisfied with the chocolate part though graham crackers and marshmallows are covered in chocolate and served on a stick for these easy and delicious smores pops. smores, smores

reading about hot female athletes Seriously who Here are the 100 Hottest Olympic Athletes of 2012 Enjoy Editors note Minor revisions have been made in compliance with editorial standards 100 Laura Robson Tennis At only 18 years of age Laura Robson comes in as one of the youngest female athletes of the 100 that made the list But that hasn t slowed down the British tennis star from earning her way onto the British tennis team Will she be in London Sure Will she be playing tennis in London We won t know for sure for a few weeks but the odds are in her favor 99 Laure Manaudou Swimming Where has Laure Manaudou been over the last two years She has been out on maternity leave and has taken a brief two year break from swimming to raise her newborn daughter Manon Despite failing to achieve the levels of success in 2008 that she had in Athens back in 2004 she is back and looks better than ever having trained in 2011 where she lives in Auburn Alabama Now it s time to swim 98 Marta Zderic Handball Handball is a sport where hockey meets volleyball meets lacrosse It is a crazy sport that can be really fun to watch especially when you have beautiful women to watch too Marta Zderic is a Croatian handball goalkeeper Her job is to make sure no one throws the handball in her net It is her net and no one else s She must protect it with her life When she plays she does it well 97 Marsha Marescia Field Hockey South Africa s women s field hockey team has not finished better than ninth at the Olympics It was in 2004 Since then they have seen a dramatic improvement including qualifying for the 2012 Summer Games by winning the first round of Olympic qualifying They won the African qualifier but felt the tournament was sub standard and gave up their automatic bid Marsha Marescia in other news was named the best player of their first round pool of qualifying 96 Maja Wloszczowska Cycling If you win a silver medal in any Olympic games you want to return in four years and win a gold Maja Wloszczowska won a silver in the women s cross country back in 2008 and is back for gold 95 Stacey O Connor Volleyball Stacey O Connor earned her fame when she played for St Mary s College from 2001 2005 Of course this is still the first I am hearing about her but what else do you expect It is an Olympic year and that means we get to meet all kinds of new attractive athletes like Stacey 94 Lauren Cheney Soccer When Abby Wambach broke her leg in 2008 and had to withdraw from the Olympic team Lauren got put into the lineup and made a few appearances If you had to name the cutest athlete of the U S national women s soccer team I find it hard to pass on Lauren Cheney 93 Kosovare Asllani Soccer Kosovare Asllani was born in Kristianstad Sweden and currently plays for Sweden s national team as well as professionally for the Kristianstads DFF My spell check is going nuts right now 92 Lauren Wenger Water Polo In 2006 Lauren Wenger was named the best collegiate water polo player in NCAA D 1 winning the Peter J Cutino Award Now I know nothing about water polo except that it is one of the best Olympic sports to watch every four years She just makes it that much more interesting 91 Gevvie Stone Rowing Rowing is a sport that gets no love That might be because unless you have grown up around the sport it is boring You are watching a team of women row a boat faster than the other women Uh yawn But there is a six foot 157 pound reason to enjoy it this year Her name is Gevvie Stone She is not a favorite to win a medal in 2012 but anything can happen Just ask Stony Brook 90 Hannah England Track and Field The British middle distance runner Hannah England has a perfect name That is like being called Joe America or Cynthia Czech Republic But if she was born in Canada it might be a bit confusing 89 Kerri Walsh Jennings Beach Volleyball Kerri Walsh Jennings is only one half of the beach volleyball duo that has dominated the previous two Olympic games winning gold medals in both and never losing a set They had an unbeaten streak of 108 games before finally dropping a game They might not be coming in as the favorites this time but when the games begin they might continue that incredible Olympic run 88 Naomi Flood Kayak Naomi Flood is an athlete She can do anything if you give her a few weeks to prepare She is a six time NSW Ironwoman champion in Australia That means she has won an event that tests your endurance power skill and speed in six locations across the Australian beaches in some of the toughest conditions imaginable And she won it six times So naturally she took up kayaking 87 Becky Hammon Basketball Can someone explain why Becky Hammon plays for Russia every four years and not the United States No never mind I understand why someone would play for Russia in basketball They pay 250 000 to the players if they win a gold medal Uh check please 86 Blair Evans Swimming I have never won a medal in my life Not just Olympics I have never won a medal in anything I have won trophies in little league but everyone wins those things Blair Evans is only 21 years old and has already claimed six swimming medals in international competition That is awesome with a capital incredible 85 Amy Rodriguez Soccer Following the U S national team s epic World Cup run in 2011 Amy Rodriguez went back home and married her boyfriend and fellow USC athlete Adam Shilling So before you ask no she is not single And even if she were your chances are as good as mine slim to none 84 Daniela Hantuchova Tennis Daniela Hantuchova has been dealing with injuries and personal issues and has had problems hitting her stride in 2012 Maybe London will be the kick start she needs to get going in 2012 83 Kristyna Kolocova Beach Volleyball In the Czech Republic Kristyna Kolocova is one of the best female beach volleyball players in the country She is paired up with Marketa Slukova to form a duo who could cause some issues for other teams in London 82 Nataliya Dobrynska Heptathlete A heptathlon is a competition that features seven different events over the course of two days It involves the 100m hurdles high jump shot put 200m long jump javelin and 800m Nataliya Dobrynska cannot only do these seven events but she is the best in the world at it too She won a gold medal in 2008 and should repeat in 2012 81 Romy Tarangul Judo Romy Tarangul is a German judoist Judoite Let s just say she competes in judo She took bronze in the 2009 World Judo Championships so I m not sure if she ll make it all the way to London but we re definitely rooting for her 80 Sanya Richards Ross Track and Field Team USA women have won a gold medal in the 4x400m relay the last two Olympics Can they take home a third in a row If Sanya Richards Ross has anything to do about it they will She is coming back for another run for gold in the relay but also in the 400m individual where she took home a bronze in 2008 She is married to NFL defensive back Aaron Ross 79 Sue Bird Basketball Sue Bird has been making these lists for the past 10 years because she is one of the most attractive female basketball players the United States has ever produced But also because she is one of the best players of all time 78 Alina Talay Hurdles A hurdle is a small metal structure that stands about 33 inches high and is placed eight meters apart from each other on a track of 100m in length There are 10 of them Alina Talay is good looking This is something we know But she has the athletic ability to run fast and jump these things with ease That is the real victory Don t think so You try it 77 Angelica Wallen Handball Is it just me or is handball becoming a very interesting sport to watch in the Olympics Sweden has never won a women s team handball Olympic gold medal in the entire history of the sport In fact this is only the second time the Swedish team has qualified for the Olympics Angelica Wallen might not be a superstar but I promise you that she will be once they upset everyone else and win a gold medal this year Remember who said that in August 76 Ellen Gandy Swimming From the looks of this photo Ellen Gandy must be involved in aquatics for Great Britain I might not be a medical doctor but the chances are very high that she is an Olympic swimmer Ellen will be competing in a few different swim events this year for the butterfly one of the toughest strokes in swimming That is the Amanda Beard event and she made it look easy 75 Serena Williams Tennis Why do so many people send me hate mail about Serena Williams saying she is ugly I just don t understand it You go girl just keep silencing the haters 74 Xue Chen Beach Volleyball Xue Chen is an incredible six foot plus It is one thing to be tall but it is another when you carry around such a long and skinny frame and a game that ranks as one of the world s best She is truly amazing 73 Erika Cristiano Dos Santos Soccer With a name like Erika Cristiano Dos Santos coming up with a shorter version is inevitable So her teammates know the 2008 Silver medalist as Erika Just plain Erika 72 Misty May Treanor Beach Volleyball Misty May Treanor is the other half of the US duo who should win a medal hopefully the gold in London later this year I can spew off all the ridiculous stats of the May Walsh duo but I think you already know all about them They re probably the most famous Americans at the Olympics not named Michael Phelps 71 Luuka Jones Canoeing I hope I don t offend anyone here but I had no idea canoeing was an Olympic sport But it apparently has been since the 1936 Summer Games in Berlin Luuka Jones is the best female New Zealand has to offer in the sport and hopes to bring a medal of any kind back home They have only won eight medals in the last 76 years so it would be a nice addition to the trophy room 70 Katie Hoff Swimming Katie Hoff is as under the radar as they come for Olympians with a few medals in their closet but shouldn t be for too much longer If things go as planned she will be taking home a few medals and some of them of the golden variety Once she wins the medals the fame will follow Trust me Just ask Amanda Beard 69 Keri Anne Payne Swimming Keri Anne Payne is not your typical Olympic swimmer She specializes in the one event that only a few highly trained athletes can compete in the 10km open water marathon This is one of the newest events of the Olympics In fact it has only been around since 2008 and Keri holds the only silver medal awarded in the event She should take home a gold in 2012 If not at least she knows she could survive in the ocean if she is on a sinking ship 68 Jenn Suhr Pole Vaulting Jenn Suhr is the third best female pole vaulter in the world She is however the best in America and is our lone hope for a gold medal in the event She did take home a silver in Beijing back in 2008 Now that we are done talking numbers does anyone else notice that amazing six pack Forget about P90x I am going pole vaulting 67 Lauren Jackson Basketball For a woman if you are 6 5 your options for sports are limited You can play volleyball or basketball Lauren Jackson chose the latter She is the most dominant player in the WNBA averaging 19 2 points a game and 7 8 rebounds a game for her career Her list of awards and honors are too long to mention so I will just remind you that she plays for the Australian national team that took home the silver medal for the past three Olympics thanks to Lauren 66 Rachel Yurkovich Javelin Rachel Yurkovich makes throwing a javelin look easy She also makes it look good 65 Natalie Coughlin Swimming Natalie Coughlin isn t a flash in the pan she is the real deal having won 11 Olympic medals three of them gold since 2004 She doesn t dominate she just beats everyone else And if that wasn t good enough she has won American Swimmer of the Year three times and the World Swimmer of the Year once 64 Sophie Polkamp Field Hockey The Netherlands are the defending Olympic champions in women s field hockey Sophie Polkamp is a part of this Dutch powerhouse that should be bringing home one more gold in 2012 If Sophie Polkamp a great name wants to retire after this year I think she would have no problems getting a job as a model in the States 63 Penny Taylor Basketball Penny Taylor plays in the WNBA but that is not why I love her I love her because of those unbelievable uniforms the Australian national team wore in 2008 You remember those right The skin tight spandex Those were hilarious 62 Valentina Vezzali Fencing In the past 20 years Valentina Vezzali has won so many medals it isn t even worth the time to talk about every single one of them But since we all have a few minutes I will tell you that she has won seven Olympic medals five of them gold and since 1995 she won 37 medals from European and World championships Dominant Yes precisely 61 Jessica Landstrom Soccer The Summer Olympics feature one of my favorite female sports soccer I don t know what it is about the sport that I love but I do love it Jessica Landstrom plays for Sweden and although they have never placed higher than fourth place they still have a solid team filled with a handful of lookers like Landstrom 60 Julie Goerges Tennis Julie Goerges is scary She continues to get better with every season she plays in the WTA If you look at her numbers they have steadily improved year after year She even owns a record that most women only wish they had while Caroline Wozniacki is No 1 Goerges is perfect against her She has beaten Wozniacki twice when she was the top ranked female That is not only impressive it is something to build on for her career 59 Lesya Makhno Volleyball Lesya Makhno plays for Russia in case you couldn t tell from the skinny six foot frame and long blond hair She plays for a team that might make some noise in London next month They took home a silver medal in 2000 and 2004 but finished in a tie for fifth place in Beijing in 2008 The last thing anyone wants is a group of angry Russians playing for redemption 58 Sanne Keizer Beach Volleyball Beach volleyball is one of my favorite sports to watch at the Olympics There s sun sand the only thing that s missing is a cooler of Corona Light on the sidelines 57 Candace Parker Basketball Does anyone else wish they could take on Candace Parker in a one on one match She would not only tower over me but she would easily beat me without even allowing me a point This I can assure you But it would still be nice to give it a shot against her 56 Federica Pellegrini Swimming Outside of Federica Pellegrini Italy does not have a highly feared group of Olympic swimmers In fact Federica is the only Italian swimmer to take home a gold medal in 2008 Surprisingly Pellegrini has won 25 percent of their Olympic gold medals since the arrival of the sport in the Summer Olympics Italy has only won four gold medals in 100 years 55 Fabiana Murer Pole Vaulting For the next Olympics I will try to pay more attention to track and field With the dominance of Usain Bolt I have felt that it was lacking any suspense He is so fast that he wins races changes his clothes does a few interviews and checks his Twitter account before the others even have a chance to start But Fabiana Murer has given me hope I want to watch women s pole vaulting now that I know all the players These women can do wonders to get over a bar that high It is an amazing sport 54 Jaqueline Carvalho Volleyball Indoor volleyball may not be as fun to watch as beach volleyball but at least you don t need to spend as much money on sunscreen Also there s Jaqueline Carvalho 53 Dominika Cibulkova Tennis Dominika Cibulkova is currently ranked 12th in the world She recently upset the world s best player Victoria Azarenka during the fourth round of the French Open So I guess you can say she got game She is the coolest thing to come out of Slovakia since the parachute 52 Maggie Vessey Track and Field Maggie Vessey is more than a member of the United States track and field team She is an athlete who competes in the 800m Just to give you a point of reference That is like running from your house to the end of your street fifty times It is around a half a mile Oh and she can run it in under two minutes 51 Sandra Izbasa Gymnastics If you thought cheerleaders were ripped you need to check out professional gymnasts These ladies are built like a statue carved from marble Sandra Izbasa represents Romania a country filled with beautiful women as the favorite to take home the gold medal in the floor exercise much like she did in 2008 50 Logan Tom Volleyball Logan Tom is one of the best in the world and should help bring home a gold medal for Team USA this year We lost the gold medal game in 2008 but hope to take home a gold in 2012 49 Victoria Azarenka Tennis Victoria Azarenka was once ranked as high as No 1 in the world but has since fallen off the charts and dropped to No 2 in the WTA rankings I guess that happens when you only win the Australian Open and nothing else in 2012 Of course sarcasm was used aplenty in the last paragraph But if you didn t get that you might want to reconsider reading my other work 48 Noel Barrionuevo Field Hockey All women from Argentina are beautiful That s just my personal experience Noel Barrionuevo is a field hockey player who underlines my last statement She is a great representative of of her great country 47 Anna Chicherova High Jump Anna Chicherova is stunning This is what we know already But what we might not know is that she is also a bronze medalist high jumper from Russia And if you have ever attempted to high jump you understand just how difficult it is to clear a pole six feet in the air simply from running and jumping over it without any tools You might have to lower the pole five feet before I could do it 46 Casey Eastham Field Hockey Field hockey really does seem to have an inordinate amount of attractive athletes It s hard too Have you ever tried to play Did you know you can t use the back side of the stick It s insanity Props to these ladies for being able to handle this sport 45 Julia Wilkinson Swimming Canada is not known for their swimming They have only won 40 Olympic medals in the sport over the last 100 or so years To give you a comparison the United States has won 489 medals in the same amount of time So if Julia Wilkinson is going to do something she might want to make it happen in 2012 Not too sure they will have a better shot at winning a gold medal in the sport this year aside from her 44 April Ross Beach Volleyball Thank you Hawaii Thank you California Thanks to both states for bringing us the sexiest sport we have ever had the pleasure of watching 43 Tatiana Ariza Soccer Tatiana Ariza makes the list at 43 because she is a beautiful young woman and soccer star for the Colombian national team Her identical twin sister Natalia did not make the list because she lacks the same level of soccer skills that Tatiana possesses Otherwise she would be right here next to her 42 Nastia Liukin Gymnastics Nastia Liukin is looking to become the first woman in 50 years to repeat and win the gold medal in the women s all around event The last time it was done was in 1960 by Larisa Latynina But I bet you already knew that She hasn t looked great in 2012 but she hasn t been bad either She is just middle of the road right now but we are all hoping the gymnast can find her stride and win the gold 41 Hannah Whelan Gymnastics Hannah Whelan is not the best gymnast in the world She is not even the best in Great Britain But in 2012 she has become a fan favorite and could shock some people later this year in London And why not She has home court advantage 40 Amanda Beard Swimming Amanda Beard went from being a cute swimmer to posing for Playboy Maxim and FHM Then she fell off the map Now she is fighting to regain her spot among the greatest U S swimmers of all time I think she just might do it too 39 Elsa Baquerizo Beach Volleyball Elsa Baquerizo is living in New York but plays for Spain She hasn t been all that impressive in international play finishing as high as fourth place twice Even if she doesn t medal simply getting to the Olympics would be a feat in and of itself 38 Raphaela Folie Volleyball I can get used to seeing more beautiful women from Italy Raphaela Folie is one of them and best of all she plays volleyball So if you haven t watched the sport before you might want to set your DVR for the games in London this year It will be worth it 37 Caroline Wozniacki Tennis Caroline Wozniacki was much younger and less impressive in 2008 when she upset a higher ranked Daniela Hantuchova in Beijing She didn t win a medal but that was then This is now She has come a long way in four years and could be taking home her first Olympic medal and Denmark s second ever in tennis 36 Brianne Theisen Heptathlete Brianne Theisen the Canadian heptathlete makes running look good She also makes the shot put javelin and whatever event she is competing in during the heptathlon look good If she wins a gold medal in London she will even make that look good Are you getting the theme here 35 Laure Boulleau Soccer Soccer does not get much hotter than Laure Boulleau Her speed is one of the most impressive things about her She has the ability to run down any ball All she needs now is an Olympic medal 34 Swin Cash Basketball I am not going to lie to my fans and readers I do not follow the WNBA I apologize to any players or fans but I just can t get into it I love basketball but can t stand the WNBA So I had no idea Swin Cash who is looking better than ever by the way was still playing basketball But she is and should be one of the main reasons the USA wins an Olympic gold medal 33 Nicole Reinhardt Canoeing Nicole Reinhardt is a German canoeing specialist She won a gold medal in Beijing in 2008 for the K 4 500m event 32 Jen Kessy Beach Volleyball If not for the Walsh May duo in beach volleyball Jen Kessy just might have become the best the U S had to offer in 2008 But when life throws you lemonades grab some vodka and start a party Jen Kessy needs to get the party started and beat them out anyway if she wants to play in London 31 Jessica Ennis Track and Field Jessica Ennis can do any event in track and field She can sprint jog throw jump hurdle hop spin or anything else they can think of to ask her to do She can do it She competes in the heptathlon so we already know she can do seven events but she also can do the pentathlon which is a five event competition 30 Emma Coburn Track and Field Emma Coburn is a participant in the 3000m steeplechase The steeplechase is a combination obstacle course track event To give you a better idea of how it looks it used to be run by horses 29 Marketa Slukova Beach Volleyball Marketa Slukova is a beach volleyball player from the Czech Republic She s a pretty cool girl Just check out her interview here Which colour describes you the best and why not red Yellow Because yellow Yellow Totally 28 Kelci Bryant Diving Kelci Bryant is the first diver to make the list The University of Minnesota beauty will be attempting to bring the U S its first Olympic medal in diving since 2000 27 Heather Mitts Soccer Heather Mitts is a soccer star for Team USA If she makes the team this year which she should then she will have a chance at being the only woman in U S history to medal in three Olympic games She didn t play too much last year due to an injury but she summer olympics,

it is no longer cosmically impossible for Boston to win a World Series Just for good measure the Red Sox won the World Series again in 2007 But what about that pesky 86 year drought Was there really a curse preventing the Sox from being successful Here s a chronological breakdown that will teach you everything you need to know about The Curse of the Bambino We ll also reveal some facts about the curse that might surprise you hint we ve got the real dirt on Jimmy Buffett Jimmy Fallon and Bill Buckner 1 Boston Started Out Strong It s important to note that the Red Sox weren t always a bad team In fact they were quite good just before the invention of the short wave radio All 28 members of the original team in front of all 75 of the original fans The Boston Americans apparently they got to go first on pick your team name day were the very first franchise to win the World Series Not only that but in the first 15 Fall Classics played Boston won 5 of them many in the later part of the 1910 s This dominance can be attributed to one person the greatest player in the history of the game Maybe you ve heard of him His name was Babe Ruth 2 The Babe was a Broadway Producer Sort of After the Red Sox won their 3rd championship in 4 years thanks largely in part to the fact that Babe Ruth was a home run hitting stud in a time when most of baseball was played using strategy and small ball the Bambino asked for a much deserved raise After all he was filling the seats and making the sport popular and accessible to the American public George Herman Ruth Mrs McGovern s 5th Grade Class However Red Sox owner Harry Frazee wanted none of it and instead sold Ruth to the Yankees He used that money to finance a play called My Lady Friends which was later released as the Broadway musical No No Nanette Both the show and the Yankees performed much better than the Red Sox did over the next 8 decades winning a combined 6 Tony s and 26 Championships before the Red Sox could win either The Sox continue to be shut out of the Tony nominations despite their advances in both lighting and costume design 3 Trust Me They Really Didn t Win While the people of Boston know their pain all too well the rest of the country is a far more casual observer of the Red Sox and therefore many of them swear they saw some Red Sox World Series celebrations at some point between 1918 and 2004 Indeed the Red Sox appeared in 4 championship series before finally winning their 5th in 2004 however all 4 ended in futility Fisk doing the YMCA in the on deck circle Red Sox and Good Will Hunting fans alike know the story of the 1975 World Series Carlton Fisk hits a dramatic game winning home run down the foul line frantically tries to wave the ball fair gets his wish and subsequently turns Fenway Park into a mob scene However what many people forget is that it was only Game 6 Winning that game guaranteed a Game 7 which they then went on to lose 4 3 4 Billy Buckner Got a Raw Deal Moving ahead 11 years we arrive at the next and final time we will see the Red Sox lose the World Series If the city of Boston had to summarize the entire season in three words they would be F BILL BUCKNER Even the umpire tries to help out Buck pointing to the ball in disgust Bill Buckner committed an error A horrible horrible error He allowed a groundball to pass directly under his glove which allowed the winning run to score in a previously tied game However history has conveniently left some things out Once again it was Game 6 There were 3 hits 3 runs and a wild pitch allowed in that inning by Boston pitching all of which were more damaging than Buckner s error as they erased the Red Sox lead and made it a tied game Bill Buckner was never convicted of a felony because of his performance in that game Perhaps no fans in the history of professional sports have ever been more violent ruthless and downright awful to a player than Boston was to Bill Buckner He was released the following season partially for his own safety after receiving countless amounts of hate mail and death threats It wasn t until 2008 after the Red Sox had won TWO Championships that Buckner was invited back to Fenway to throw out the first pitch of the season He received a 4 minute standing ovation and was thereby released from the witness protection program 5 Fans Tried Lots of Crazy Ways to Break the Curse Over the years fans and extremists have gone to ridiculous lengths to try to rid their city of the curse up to and including exorcism vandalization and even the proposed exhumation of Babe Ruth s corpse There was even an elaborate attempt staged by Jimmy Buffett Jimmy looks more historic in black and white Yes even Jimmy Buffett went so far as to channel the ghost of the Bambino as played by his high bassist and a witch doctor as played by his high drummer putting them on stage to fight or something Whatever the method numerous attempts were tried and failed Until 6 Jimmy Fallon Broke the Curse That s right And why not It makes perfect sense If the curse of the Bambino began with a musical why not end it with a film Bogart and Garbo they ain t Hollywood law states that if you are investing millions of dollars into a film that hinges on a piece of history not changing it will definitely change Apparently the original Fever Pitch was supposed to end the same way the previous 86 drafts of the script ended But when the 2004 Red Sox won the World Series the ending had to be rewritten As it turns out nobody saw the movie anyway so it wouldn t have been that big of a deal if they had just left it 7 The Truth There Was No Curse After years of futility and heartbreak baseball fans can now rest easy knowing the truth about the Curse of the Bambino it never existed If you ask any baseball fan why the Cubs have yet to win the World Series they will tell you it is because of the Billy Goat Curse However if you ask any Cubs fan the same question they will sit you down for a 90 minute lecture on the past faults and shortcomings of the team before insisting that THIS is the year it all changes Same story different scapegoat True Red Sox fans never believed in the curse The simple truth is that some teams just have crappy centuries Baseball is not an exercise in probability Teams do not have a 1 in 30 chance of winning the World Series each year Professional baseball is so much more complicated than that and the fact is if a team is mismanaged mishandled and possibly just a tad unlucky for 80 years it s easy to see how they could miss 86 times before finally winning once Although it is easy for Boston fans to breath a sigh of relief having two championships under their belt many of them will never forget the cursed years Whether it was fate a curse or just a string of bad luck those days are over The city of Boston and the Babe can rest easy for red sox fans, 2004 ushered in the dawn of a new era; an era where it is no longer cosmically impossible for boston to win a world series. just for good"",""url"":""amog sports 7 didnt red sox

American Hockey League with this curious creation Aggressive yet elegant 48 Florida Panthers 3rd Jersey Blue and darker blue aren t exactly Panthers colors but this jersey as a whole reeks of solid domination On the other hand it also screams Pittsburgh Penguins 47 Pittsburgh Pirates Negro League Jersey There s nothing like Heritage Week to bring back the old days The Homestead Grays clearly believed in simplicity and class Less continues to be more 46 Edmonton Oil Kings Military Jersey This Western Hockey League club is prepared to do whatever it takes to cement its name in history forever And that includes fashioning a Jackson Pollack esque display of paint madness More simply referred to as the Military Appreciation Jerseys Abstract art at its finest 45 Cincinnati Stingers Away Jersey This 70s World Hockey Association masterpiece can t possibly be gulped all at once It s too powerful Here is the rest 44 Kingston Frontenacs Don Cherry Jersey The Kingston Frontenacs are still several suits away from reaching greatness but the Ontario Hockey League just got a lot cooler with this mockery of NHL analyst and nut Don Cherry Risky business though as this can often be misconstrued as brutal 43 Atlanta Braves Throwback Jersey Worn by Hank Aaron and his pack of Braves during the franchise s first two seasons in Atlanta 1966 67 this simple off white piece of cloth is a pleasant vacation for the pupils With a player number replacing the chest high tomahawk and an iconic badge on the sleeve these jerseys present solid compliments to the everyday white and red 42

these 80th season jerseys truly are inspired by bumblebees then due credit goes to those talented honey dwellers They may be tough on the eyes but these obtuse jerseys are a refreshing and necessary addition to the NFL Only in doses though 38 France New Away Jersey The stripe work may seem excessive but let s be real You can never have enough stripes Just as long as France doesn t get mistaken for a pack of referees 37 Anaheim Ducks Goldberg Jersey David Wright continues to amaze us with his potent disregard for the routine This is no regular Ducks sweater But it s clearly phenomenal 36 Montreal Canadiens Centennial Jersey These 1912 1913 throwbacks give us another reason to love stripes But we re still searching for Waldo 35 Turkey New Away Jersey Simple yet effective is the

focused on keeping their elegant white skates squeaky clean 32 Tampa Bay Lightning 3rd Jersey Released in 08 these silver trimmed knockouts are subtly intense It s refreshing The diagonal style lettering is a slight but necessary detail 31 Miami Heat Orange and Pink Jersey They only played in the ABA for two years 1968 1970 but that didn t keep today s superstars from remembering the Miami

competition The Hartford Whalers esque feel gives the Whale a mighty advantage on camera 28 Los Angeles Kings Throwback Jersey This purple and yellow elegance has rarely let down the illustrious

Terrapins New Jersey If the checkered oddly shaped new Maryland jerseys don t get your senses riled up perhaps their gold alternates will Loving the shoulder pad creativity at this moment although this wild flow may become a visual issue in the future 26 Portugal New Away Jersey The precise coloring cornered numbering and vibrant crosshairs make Portugal s new away kit one for the ages Quality over quantity 25 ZSC Lions Victoria Cup Jersey Founded in 1930 the ZSC Lions are clearly experienced in the art of victory But this Switzerland club proved they were more than just a stylish crew when they beat the Chicago Blackhawks in 2009 for the Victoria Cup trophy 24 Boston Bruins 3rd Jersey With a bear hogging the center there s little about this jersey that doesn t scream amazing We may despise Boston s hockey club but we love their Bruin 23 Washington Redskins Alternate Jersey These yellow and red studs are a refreshing clean cut addition to the often cliched gridiron fashion

Home Jersey A ferocious blue display is perfectly complimented by slight gold lettering on the chest and sleeves Nike s new France home kit has all of Western Europe in a euphoric state 16 San Antonio Spurs Throwback Jersey From 1967 to 1973 the Dallas Chaparrals were easily the most stunning pack of ballers in the ABA And then they moved to San Antonio long before the Spurs decided to pay necessary tribute 15 New York Mets Throwback Jersey It seems the Mets have finally realized the atrocity surrounding their black uniforms A legendary NY scripted on their chest seals the deal Respect for baseball s former New York Giants 14 Quidditch Olympics Jersey The nerdiest sport on the planet just became perhaps the most fashionable as well with the introduction of their 2012 Summer Olympic

pleasing presentation would define the Original Six and the NHL for years to come 9 Croatia New Home Jersey The design team designated to Croatia s EURO 2012 home kit seems to be simultaneously poking at greatness and insanity But let s be real this is pure genius 8 Ottawa Senators Heritage Jersey It must ve been tough for Senators captain Daniel Alfredsson to contain his exuberance during this moment and we respect him for trying Sure the design is creatively perfect but it s the story behind the cloth that has us in a frenzy All it took was one suggestion from graphic designer Jacob Barrette on an Ottawa Senators message board 7 Chicago White Sox Throwback Jersey Dick Allen s hipster glasses and epic stare hog this intense moment but we re still intrigued by the powder blue button down The Ambrose Burnside sideburns complete this masterful shot 6 Los Angeles Lakers Throwback Jersey The Minneapolis Lakers would only last 13 years 1947 1960 but they certainly cemented

Sullivan for the pink touch The glistening top reeks of class and the solid neck of aggression Nicely done 4 Cleveland Cavaliers Hardwood Classic Jersey We saw the Cavs sport a blue and orange top

"http://foodformyfamily.com/recipes/perfect-all-butter-pie-crust"	"8869"	"{""title"":""Perfect All Butter Pie Crust Food for My Family "",""body"":""An easy all butter pie crust recipe to impress your friends and family with a flaky homemade crust this holiday season or any season Grab a shortening crust recipe from me over at TidyMom I recently had the opportunity to make pie at J M Smucker s in Ohio did you know they have both Pillsbury and the White Lily flour but before that even I have been putting the finishing touches on the pie chapter in my book There has been a lot of pie around these parts as of late and I d love to share some of it with you starting with the crust What Type of Crust Before we get started let s think about the pie you re making as this will help determine the crust you want Where my fresh strawberry and rhubarb pie had a cookie crust that was baked several cream pies use a cookie crumb crust Then there is the classic pastry crust made with flour and a bit of fat Pastry Crust Fats For a pastry crust one of the main components is the fat you ll be using so determining which you prefer is the next step This may be a personal preference or it may be determined by what kind of crust your mom or grandma made when you were growing up shortening any fat that is solid at room temp but for use here vegetable shortening butter it comes from cows lard rendered and unrendered pig fat a combination a combination of butter and lard shortening Making the Crust For our purposes we re using butter and elbow grease to make our pie crust You can see my food processor method over on TidyMom today as well There are benefits to both methods The food processor is a bit quicker but there is the downfall of cleaning it Plus not everyone has a food processor and maybe your food processor is in use for something else during your holiday baking session Kiera is coming along for the ride to demonstrate how easy it is to make pie crust You ll barely notice her though because her clothing choice matches the decor She looks excited to be here right Measuring the flour The first step in making pie crust is the flour and if you aren t measuring your flour correctly you ll be getting less than ideal results in the final product The most common mistake in measuring flour is to dig your measuring cup directly into the container and scooping out a big ol scoop However this packs the flour down and can mean you have too much flour in your dough Instead scoop the flour with a spoon and add it to the measuring cup then leveling with a flat edge once the cup is full The other method of getting an accurate flour measurement is to weigh the flour on a kitchen scale One cup of all purpose flour should weigh 125 grams Other flour varieties weigh different amounts though Cake flour wheat flour bleached all purpose wheat pastry flour all have different gram measurements A conversion chart can help you figure out the flour type and volume conversion Cold ingredients Pie crust is flaky because there are pieces actual pieces of butter in it rolled into thin flat sheets that when baked create the flaky layers You can imagine then that melted butter would not result in flaky layers Therefore it s important to keep the butter cold to prevent it from melting To do this it s best to start with really cold butter chunks Cut the butter into chunks and then store it in the freezer for a few minutes while you get the rest of your ingredients ready Some people go as far as to chill the bowl and the flour as well Couldn t hurt right Butter chunks When mixing in the butter use a long tined fork or a pastry blender A pastry blender is preferred because it makes cutting the butter up quick and easy but I noticed recently that it s near impossible to purchase one in stores if you don t already have one I snapped a blade of mine off when it got stuck at the back of a drawer and needed to replace it If you get in a pickle a fork works just as well You want to aim to get the butter into small bit but don t look for all of it to be tiny and flaky Those chunks of butter are the pieces that will be rolled into thin layers in your dough Butter chunks flaky layers Add in just enough icy cold water to get your dough to stick together It should still look clumpy and not like a ball Let it rest Use your hands to squish those clumps together and then form two equal discs Putting the dough in disc shape gives you a head start on that circle you re looking to roll it into after it rests Pack your dough package in the refrigerator for at least an hour before you roll it out This will help all those butter pieces to be nice and firm again and it will give you time to prepare your pie filling You could also store it in the refrigerator for a few days or in the freezer for longer The only steps left are rolling out your pie crust and placing it ever so gently into your pie plate Be sure to use as little flour as possible you could even roll between two sheets of parchment and work quickly so the butter doesn t melt which would do away with those flaky layers Then bake and fill with whatever pie your heart desires Pie

and delicious sandwich Fresh Pasta Dough Eggs and flour come together to form tender golden pasta dough Roll thinly and cook for just a minute or two before topping with fresh tomatoes extra virgin olive oil and basil Souffl\u00e9s Eggs are the key ingredient in this easier than you d think French staple Whipped egg whites are the secret to a fluffy texture while the yolk adds richness to the filling Quiche Lighten up this often calorie laden breakfast treat by using whole milk instead of cream and filling it with chopped green leafy vegetables For a complete and balanced meal it s best to combine eggs with whole grain and vegetables says Nicole Geurin R D Make your own whole wheat crust with olive oil instead of butter or shortening for an even healthier take on the classic Simply Baked Crack two eggs in a small ovenproof ramekin Top with finely chopped vegetables and a splash of whole milk or half and half Bake until whites are set but yolks are still runny enough for dipping

"http://eyecandy.nanakaze.net/?p=385"	"10401"	"{""title"":""15 Ways to Naturally Colour Flavour White Chocolate "",""body"":""Creating desserts with dark and white chocolate is great but sometimes you may get bored with the restricted choice of colours Since my recent post about the simple chocolate painting technique I ve felt the urge to find methods to dye chocolate so I could paint more elaborate pictures The difficulty is that chocolate doesn t mix well with regular liquid food colouring so I decided to go with powder alternatives instead some of them homemade I refrained from using artificial food colouring It s not that I condemn it because of fear of health risks It s rather because I like being challenged The fact that I erm don t have access to artificial colouring powder might count as a reason as well Colouring with natural ingredients is more fun anyway because it enhances appearance as well as flavour I ve had a lot of fun experimenting and came up with 15 ways to colour and flavour white chocolate naturally But I m sure there are a lot more ways to do it I would be glad if you shared your own ideas in the comment section In all the examples here I melted regular white chocolate in block form mixed it with the corresponding powder and let it harden in a silicone mold If you like it you can buy it here Per piece I mixed 8 grams of chocolate with 1 4 measured pinches of powder 1 pinch 0 5ml And I sieved the powder whenever I could Top coconut kinako and cinnamon chocolate Bottom original white chocolate block Orange zest turmeric and chili chocolate Red berry red beet kinako and red berry cornflower chocolate Cornflower seaweed and green tea chocolate Black sesame dessert powder poppy seed and black sesame chocolate How to make White Chocolate with Coconut Simply mix in instant coconut milk powder I used 3 pinches for one piece Colour Maybe it s just my imagination but I think the coconut chocolate is whiter than the original white chocolate Flavour Didn t really taste like coconut I blame it on the poor quality of the instant powder How to make Beige Chocolate with Kinako Kinako toasted soybean flour is available at Japanese grocery stores but you could also prepare it yourself by following this recipe here I added 3 pinches Colour Very nice and even colour that can be used if you re aiming for sand or skin tones Flavour Kinako on its own is a disgrace but mixed with sweet stuff it s delicious try kinako ice cream The taste will remind you of peanut butter How to make Brown Chocolate with Cinnamon 2 pinches of ground cinnamon that s all there is to it Colour Well it s brown Not too exciting Flavour Fabulicious Looks like regular chocolate but tastes different How to make Yellow Chocolate with Orange Zest You need an organic thoroughly washed orange and zest it Heat the zest in the microwave for about 5 minutes until it s dry and grind it in a mortar or with a machine I used 2 pinches Colour Nice orange yellow Depending on how finely you grind it texture is more or less visible Flavour Quite a pronounced orange aroma with a bitter note that fits perfectly with white chocolate How to make Yellow Chocolate with Turmeric Turmeric powder is easily available at Asian markets I added only one pinch Colour What an intense and consistent colour It has a hint of ochre in it Flavour Not too good It tasted a little soapy to be honest Next time I ll definitely add less powder How to make Orange Chocolate with Chili I ground Korean chili for this one and added 2 pinches Korean chili is superb seriously Colour Beautiful grainy orange Flavour Not bad at all but very spicy Probably best in combination with dark chocolate How to make Pink Chocolate with Red Berries For this one you need to grind freeze dried red berries Regular dried berries won t do because they re too chewy It may be difficult to find this so here s a trick buy Kellogg s Special K Red Berries cereal and pick out the fruit pieces D I used a freeze dried berry selection with strawberry red currant and raspberry Pinches added 3 Colour Gorgeous pink with little grains Flavour Fantastic An intense fruity aroma with a bit of a sour note This flavour is certainly a crowd pleaser Be sure to make a big batch How to make Red ish Chocolate with Red Beet Kinako I used a little trick for this one Mix a bit of kinako powder with and equal amount of red beet juice and heat it in the microwave for a few minutes until it s dry Grind it and you have sort of an instant red beet powder I used 3 pinches Colour It s not a profound red it s more like pinkish red wine colour I guess Flavour Much to my surprise it didn t taste like beets at all It tasted like a mixture of fruits and nuts How to make Purple Chocolate with Red Berries Cornflower Grind freeze dried red berries and dried cornflower see blue and pink chocolate for more information together I used 3 pinches Colour Well it was supposed to look like purple but actually the colour is rather unidentifiable Flavour The berry flavour was dominant How to make Blue Chocolate with Cornflower Cornflower not to be confused with cornflour is a flower with an intense blue colour It s also known under the Latin name Centaurea Cyanus Getting dried cornflower petals is probably a bit difficult Try your luck in stores that specialise on condiments or tea I ground the cornflower with a few grains of salt and used 2 pinches Colour A pale greyish blue with texture Flavour Nice but not a very distinct aroma It reminded me a bit of lavender How to make Green Chocolate with Seaweed Don t say I m crazy Commercially sold seaweed chocolate does exist after all I used Aonori which is a type of Japanese seaweed often used as an okonomiyaki topping but other types of thin dried seaweed layers should work fine too Roast the seaweed before grinding I used 2 pinches Colour Pale olive green with little grains Flavour It s chocolate with an intense seaweed flavour Without a doubt it does take getting used to You either hate it or love it How to make Green Chocolate with Green Tea Powder Simply use matcha green tea powder You should be able to get this in Japanese grocery stores One pinch was enough Colour A very strong dark green and even colour Flavour Green tea chocolate is rather bitter but delicious Don t miss out on that one How to make Grey Chocolate with Black Sesame Dessert Powder I used black sesame instant dessert powder that I bought at an Asian grocery store I think you re supposed to make hot sesame dessert soup with it I added 4 pinches of it Colour Light grey colour with a few grains Flavour It s okay but not delicious Doesn t compare to the real thing at all How to make Grey Chocolate with Poppy Seed Roast the poppy seeds and grind them You won t get powder from this but it will blend with the chocolate anyway I used 2 pinches Colour A grainy grey with a hint of brown Flavour I didn t really like it It tasted a bit like rubber What went wrong How to make Grey Chocolate with Black Sesame Seeds Roast and grind just like the poppy seeds I used 3 pinches Colour Dark grey with black grains Flavour Yummy Intense roasted black sesame flavour with a hint of bitterness One of the most popular flavours of this selection Your head is spinning with more ideas I d love to hear them "",""url"":""eyecandy

"http://www.joepastry.com/2008/how-to-laminate-dough/"	"7309"	"{""title"":""How to Laminate Dough Joe Pastry "",""body"":""Every laminated dough be it puff pastry croissant or Danish begins its life as a thick slab of butter encased in a dough envelope This 3 layer dough butter dough package is then flattened and folded however many times it takes to get the number of layers the maker is after A folded flaky pastry for say a galette can have as few as 27 layers Croissants often have 81 Danish 243 and puff pastry can have as many as 2187 though I prefer the less flaky version of 729 What these oddly specific numbers have in common is that they re all factors of the number 3 243 is three to the fifth power which is what you get when you turn i e execute a letter fold on a three layer dough five times Pretty neat stuff that requires nowhere near the work you d think So let s begin then shall we Puff pastry which is the specific dough I m making here is one of the easier laminated doughs Its composition is easy enough to remember for every pound of butter one pound of flour and one cup of water plus one teaspoon each of salt and lemon juice It begins not unlike a pie crust by rubbing a small quantity about 5 of the butter into the flour and salt mixture Once that s done just enough of the water lemon juice mixture is added to bring the dough together As with all laminated doughs it s best to knead it as little as possible since you want to activate as little gluten as you can Notice the finished dough looks a bit dry and shaggy Park that on the counter for 20 minutes and meanwhile make the butter block It s a pretty straightforward affair requiring only the most rudimentary tools primarily this A club Actually a Chinese rolling pin but the overall effect is the same Next we need a some butter large pieces ideally left out of the fridge for about 20 minutes Below is about a pound of it sitting on a double layer of plastic wrap It s the minimum I usually work with since I figure if I m going to the trouble of rolling pastry I d like to have some left over to freeze Notice there s flour on top That helps the butter maintain its consistency longer which is important for reasons you ll soon see Add about three tablespoons per pound of butter So now all we do is cover the butter and flour with another double thick layer of plastic and apply Club A to Butter Pile B Repeat Repeat Repeat Feel good You bet it does And if your spouse and or children aren t running into the room looking terror stricken you re not hitting hard enough Keep letting out your pent up frustration until it looks rather flat Take off the plastic wrap don t worry if you ve beaten a couple of holes in it and using a knife or bench scraper cut it into a rough square and pile the trimmings back up on top Repeat the merciless beating What s it all for other than stress release Good question What you re shooting for here is a butter consistency rather like play dough Not too firm since you want it to spread as you roll the dough out But then not too soft either since if the butter actually melts it ll soak into the dough and ruin the layering effect What you re after is a plastic texture that isn t at all greasy looking or feeling If the butter starts to shine it s too warm Put it back in the fridge for half an hour and start over with the tension release hey why not The magic texture may take only one good pounding It all depends on the temperature of the butter and the room That consistency looks like this apale dull powdery looking surface Once you re there you want to lightly shove it back into the shape of a big butter pat using the side of your club like so Set it aside for a moment Now is the time to retrieve your dough and roll it out into a square slightly larger than the butter pat Don t worry if it looks scaly and nasty all will be made right in the end Put the butter pat on top like so And begin to fold it up As you re doing this you want to pull the dough up around the corners and edges to make sure it s as taught as reasonably possible Next squeeze the all the holes and seams closed use a little water if you like So now what do you think is next If you guessed more of this you d be right Because when making pastry violence is always the first resort You want to start by making cross shaped impressions in the dough then start whacking the envelope at perpendicular angles The point of all this to drive the softened butter as far as possible to the edges of the packet Smack it then rotate the package a quarter turn and do the next edge Smack turn Smack turn Smack turn And of course along the way if you see any conspicuous mounds of butter push up in the middle give them a smack for good measure no need to discriminate A minute or two of this and the dough should be starting to flatten out which means it s time to produce the rolling pin Here a big ol honkin 25 inch pin is nice but a small one will work too if that s all you ve got If you ve beaten the envelope with sufficient ferocity there should be butter within half an inch of all the edges If not it s not the end of the world Just grab the bench scraper and trim the dough until you can either see a thin layer of butter or you can feel it close to the edge Next give the dough a couple of more firm rolls with the pin until it s about a third longer than it is wide At which point you brush any residual flour off of the inside and just fold it like a letter Repeat the rolling and folding process once more and park the dough on a cookie sheet in the fridge for 15 20 minutes Having crested the difficulty hill it is now time to crack a celebratory beer because it s all smooth sailing from here whatever that curious mixture of metaphors means All you have to do is pull the dough out every so often and give a turn or two depending on the dough you re making In the early stages of a dough rolling project I find I can get away with two turns between chills But judge for yourself If the dough is feeling extremely limp you find that you re breaking layers just by handling it or butter oozes out looking shiny give it more fridge time Alternately if as you roll you notice that the butter just under the surface of the dough is rigid and breaking apart like icebergs off the Antarctic ice sheet give it a little less If I m making puff pastry which requires six turns minimum I can usually do two turns at a time early on Much past four turns though and the dough begins to get a elastic and b warm So I let the dough chill for 20 minutes before the fifth and sixth turns and half an hour for the seventh if I m doing one Once it s all done I typically roll the dough into a long strip cut it into roughly pound size pieces and freeze it in bags Boy does this stuff ever come in handy "",""url"":""joepastry 2008 how to laminate

All PW Recipes Sushi This is the first of several sushi lessons brought to you by me displaced sushi lover and Cody a half Japanese sushi chef from the big city Cody visited the ranch last week a birthday present from Marlboro Man who figured it was the only thing on earth besides a pug that I would possibly want and spent a few hours deconstructing the basics of sushi so that sad souls like me would have the skills to prepare it from time to time Or every day I love sushi so much Today we re going to start with the basic building block of sushi rice Rice is the basis of sushi I repeat Rice is the basis of sushi According to sushi chef Cody you could slap a little slice of Spam on a small pillow of rice and it would technically qualify as sushi Spam Sushi Gross me out the door Though I ll bet my dad would love it He learned to love Span in Vietnam Sushi has an interesting beginning people in China funny since sushi is a Japanese dish used to cure large pieces of fish in between two flat layers of vinegar soaked rice They d create a flat layer of rice pour a vinegar solution over it then lay a single layer of fish all over the rice Then they d top it with another vinegar soaked layer of rice and let it cure for a length of time as a means of preserving it When the fish was ready they d discard the rice and keep the fish I guess somewhere along the way someone got the munchies early grabbed a big mouthful of the fish and rice and decided it was a treat in itself I would have been that person According to Cody the Sushi Chef the first step toward making perfect sushi rice is to cook the rice properly 1 Use short or medium grain rice It s more starchy and round than the long grain variety which just won t hold together well enough to support ingredients in sushi Many stores now sell specifically labeled sushi rice 2 Before you cook it wash rinse the rice until the water runs totally clear about five or six times If you don t thoroughly rinse the rice it ll end up in a big sticky ball There s enough internal starch in the rice for it to sufficiently hold together for sushi so get all the stuff on the outside OFF by rinsing well 3 Use a rice cooker steamer Rice made on the stovetop will not work for sushi it won t be the right consistency Rice cookers are widely available for as low as 12 4 Add the rinsed rice to the rice cooker with equal parts water and follow the directions for the rice cooker After it s done transfer the cooked rice to a large mixing bowl The second step for making perfect sushi rice is to add a vinegar solution called the su Sushi Su4 parts rice wine vinegar2 parts sugar1 part sake or mirin wine You ll need 1 part sushi su for every 4 parts rice So using the above proportions here s a sample recipe for sushi rice 4 cups short grain sushi rice1 cup rice wine vinegar1 2 cup sugar1 4 cup sake or mirin a Japanese rice wine 1 Heat vinegar sugar and sake or mirin in a saucepan just to dissolve and combine Allow to cool to room temperature 2 Cook rice according to rice cooker directions Transfer to large mixing bowl 3 Pour su vinegar mixture over the rice gently folding to incorporate 4 Let rice stand for 10 minutes then fold again Rice should be shiny not mushy and have a slightly tart sweet taste Cover with a warm wet towel and keep warm Cody brought a whole cooler full of sushi rice the showoff Sushi rice should be slightly warm when it s time to make the Nigiri or Sushi Rolls We ll get into this much more on another day but just to give you a little primer Nigiri is the classic piece of fish on top of a pillow of rice style of sushi that everyone recognizes No Cody the Sushi Chef is not a medical technician He s simply putting on a pair of food grade plastic gloves to make handling the sushi easier But doesn t he look like he s about to perform an exam Sorry Cody To form the rice for nigiri sushi Cody grabs a heaping tablespoon of the sushi rice Then he works it around in his hand Forming it Until it s the shape of a small pillow Then he places a piece of fish shrimp yellowfin tuna yellowtail salmon on top of the pillow of rice Mmmmm hello lover I want to dip you in wasabi clouded soy sauce and pet you and dress you up and play with you and call you George And then I want to eat you I ll be showing you how to prepare the shrimp necessary for this delicious nigiri sushi in the coming days it s a piece of cake But today It s about the rice baby The most common form of sushi these days accounting for almost 90 of sushi sold in Cody s restaurant is the Sushi Roll I m obsessed with sushi rolls and you wouldn t believe the variety Cody makes We ll be covering all the details regarding the seaweed and other ingredients for different sushi rolls during the course of our sushi journey together but here I wanted to show you what the layer of sushi rice looks like on the sheet of dried seaweed Do you see how the rice is spread into a sheet but has still maintained it s light non mushy quality It s all about the rice baby It s all about the rice Didn t I just post a hamburger recipe here like day before yesterday I m sorry about the identity crisis here But I have to be me And me loves sushi Here s a little supporting video footage of Cody the Sushi Chef discussing sushi rice We didn t have our good mic or lighting in place yet but it ll at least allow you to be there with us and listen to Cody s unlikely California surfer dude voice He was the nicest sushi chef I ve ever met He s also the only sushi chef I ve ever met But I d venture a guess he s one of the nicer ones Enjoy the video Some of the information is a little redundant but he does throw in a couple of helpful nuggets along the way And excuse the pesky clicking of my still camera I couldn t get enough Sushi Rice by Cody the Sushi Chef from Pioneer Woman on Vimeo And here s the HD version since I secretly want to be a nerd Untitled from Pioneer Woman on Vimeo Peace Love

body"",""body"":""Alcohol like caffeine has an enormous reputation but loose understanding in popular culture Learn how it s absorbed and how fast why it s essential to reality TV altercations its paradoxical sexual effects and its life lengthening potential whether red wine or Bud Light Image via TheDeliciousLife Everyone it seems takes their cues on how alcohol affects the mind and body from an eclectic mix of knowledge personal experience pop culture tall tales of long nights the latest studies to make the health news wires and second hand tips You might have gathered that alcohol is a depressant that it s dehydrating that you can drink about one drink an hour and stay relatively sober Some of that is true But much of it depends on a large number of factors Let s dig into some of the things we do and don t know about alcohol Relevant sources are linked where cited but much of the background material comes from Buzz The Science and Lore of Alcohol and Caffeine new ish Kindle edition linked there It s a science based tome written in a clear language by Stephen Braun and was the main reference for our take on caffeine We re taking a few things for granted here that you understand some of the basics of alcohol consumption blood alcohol content legal limits what it feels like when you ve had too much to drink and the serious illness of alcoholism We re not trying to help you get loaded quicker or drink more for longer periods We re digging into some of the science behind how you and alcohol interact It Works Differently on Full Stomachs Young Women Some Asians and Aspirin Takers Your body sees alcohol as a poison or at least as something it doesn t actually want inside it To fight back and sober you up humans produce an enzyme called alcohol dehydrogenase That enzyme gets its shot at your alcohol when it attempts to pass through the stomach lining and when it reaches your liver primarily On contact it snatches a hydrogen atom off the ethanol molecules in your drink rendering it into non intoxicating acetaldehyde Humans can then use aldehyde dehydrogenase as a kind of clean up crew breaking down the acetaldehyde that s sometimes considered a cause of hangovers along with dehydration For more on the myths versus reality of hangovers see our guide to hangover cures Image via Wikimedia Commons Seems pretty simple no It s a fight between how much you can drink versus how fast your enzymes can bust down your indulgences and their byproducts But many factors affect certain people s production of the two alcohol crushing compounds Alcohol dehydrogenase AD is for reasons not wholly understood more effective in men than in women Young men in fact may have up to 70 to 80 percent greater enzyme activity in the presence of alcohol But men s AD effectiveness also drops off with age at a faster rate than in women such that by around 55 or 60 men may find themselves able to handle less alcohol than their female counterparts all other factors being equal A full stomach helps break down alcohol but not because your food soaks up the alcohol When you eat a big meal your stomach s pyloric sphincter a kind of release valve into the small intestine closes tightly Your body knows that you ve got food that should get a good going over in your stomach before it heads straight to the high absorption small intestine so it keeps it there and the AD in your stomach has more time to work on the alcohol Drink on an empty stomach and the liquid quickly makes it into the small intestine where there s more than 200 square meters of surface area for absorption into your body Image via peretzpup Another big factor in alcohol absorption and alcohol s effects is genetics Your great great grandparents have a say in how buzzed your Friday night gets for sure but for roughly one third to half of Asian drinkers it s more than a slight variance Alcohol flush reaction a flushing of the face when drinking occurs because the enzyme clean up crew aldehyde dehydrogenase is mutated by just one amino acid That changes how effective its molecules are in bonding with and busting up acetaldehyde With excess acetaldehyde in their system those with a flush reaction get red faced and can experience heart palpitations dizziness and severe nausea in extreme cases Your own genetic makeup of AD and aldehyde dehydrogenase affect your ability to break down alcohol and its byproducts in similar fashion Don t take aspirin before drinking unless you love hangovers Aspirin seriously cuts the effectiveness of your body s AD enzymes In one 1990 study the average blood alcohol levels of those who took two maximum strength aspirin tablets before drinking were an average of 26 percent higher than those who were aspirin free Other studies have suggested even more impact on your body s ability to break down alcohol That also means more acetaldehyde in your system down the line so you ll learn your lesson quickly if you re considering aspirin as a helper Side Note Absorption and Elimination Is a Curve Not a Straight Line Think you ve got a handle on the basic one drink per hour algorithm for your weekend nights Check out this explainer from a forensic toxicology lab which also links up an advanced Blood Alcohol Calculator Your BAC moves through plateaus responds differently to drinks higher than 20 25 percent alcohol by volume and eliminates some alcohol in pure form which is how police can measure it on your breath It Extends Your Life Kind Of Every few weeks it seems a new study suggests a glass of wine or sometimes any old drink lengthens your life if you don t overdo it Plucking just one out of the pile you ll see that in Alcoholism Clinical and Experimental Research researchers followed 1824 people over a total of 20 years as they aged between 55 and 65 Of those who abstained entirely 69 percent died Among those who drank in moderate amounts 41 percent died which was 23 percent less than the light drinkers Even heavy drinkers fared better than abstainers with just 61 percent passing away during the study period How could a substance that everybody and their five brothers tell you to go easy on extend your life Popular theories center on the antioxidants and resveratrol compounds found in wines or on the studies showing alcohol as increasing levels of HDL good cholesterol But Jonah Lehrer at Wired points out the not so obvious the link between a longer life and alcohol may not be direct but it s likely very real It relates to the long term benefits of reducing stress as well as alcohol s role in facilitating get togethers and acting as a social lubricant What does this have to do with longevity In recent years sociologists and epidemiologists have begun studying the long term effects Direct PDF link of loneliness It turns out to be really dangerous We are social primates and when we re cut off from the social network we are more likely to die from just about everything but especially heart disease At this point the link between abstinence and social isolation is merely hypothetical But given the extensive history of group drinking it s what we do when we come together it seems likely that drinking in moderation makes it easier for us develop and nurture relationships And it s these relationships that help keep us alive Image via LINXBAS Theoretically then you might get some of the same benefits if you were a savvy social Diet Coke drinker But it s likely a combination of actual alcohol effects along with their social expressions that leads to study after study showing drinkers as getting some kind of life extending benefit It Doesn t Kill Brain Cells but Does Inhibit Them It s true that at high concentrations like the nearly 100 percent pure alcohol used in sterilizing solutions alcohol can indeed kill cells and neurons and nearly anything else But given that the blood reaching your brain is only at 0 08 percent alcohol if you re legally intoxicated or say 0 25 percent if you ve just closed a major deal in Tokyo it s not doing a lot of damage to your actual brain cells liver cells and other organs with long term chronic abuse are another matter Don t believe it A major study by Grethe Jensen and colleagues in 1993 matched brain samples taken from both alcoholics and nonalcoholics from groups of the two dead from non alcohol related causes There were no significant differences found in either the number or density of brain cells between the groups Misconception Junction tackles Jensen s study and the topic in more depth What alcohol can and does do to your brain is affect the way your neurons get their firing triggers from glutamate It infiltrates the glutamate receptors in your synapses hurting their ability to send off their normal fire messages Alcohol has this impact all across your brain the parts that control muscles speech coordination judgment and so on Keep that in mind the next time you or someone else claims that they drive golf or otherwise perform some task better with alcohol s help As Stephen Braun puts it in Buzz The Science and Lore of Alcohol and Caffeine Substances such as cocaine and LSD work like pharmacological scalpels altering the functioning of only one or a handful of brain circuits Alcohol is more like a pharmacological hand grenade It affects practically everything around it Side Note That s Also Why It Uh Inhibits Sex The studies and implications are numerous to say the least but if you want a thumbnail understanding of how alcohol as Shakespeare put it provokes the desire but takes away the performance it has to do with the firing of nerves in the brain and elsewhere that would relax the arteries enough to get both parties moving It s a bit more complex than that and drinking in moderation can be a net benefit in some cases but alcohol paradoxically doesn t help one specific region of your self to relax Side Note 2 Alcohol is Particularly Effective at Inhibiting Memories Like the sexual response the way the brain makes memories is far from comprehensively understood But it does seem linked to N Methyl D aspartic acid or NMDA the receptor for which alcohol seems particularly adept at interfering with according to Braun Studies have shown that while subjects under alcohol s influence can recall existing memories events happening during inebriation are regularly hard to remember It varies with the amount consumed and seems to top out at a serious 0 2 percent blood alcohol content but anything from flimsy recall to full on blackouts are possible due to alcohol s unique bond with the stuff that should make memories It Makes Other People Seem More Intentional If you d never been raised to think things through you d assume that most actions people took were fairly intentional and possibly pointed at causing you harm The same holds when people are asked to make snap judgments about things happening But give yourself any amount of time and you ll generally think out all the reasons something could have happened avoiding your natural intentionality bias and preventing heated arguments with otherwise close friends bar altercations and 80 percent of all reality show plots Image via terren in Virginia But as you might have guessed that reasoned thinking gets lost when there s a night s worth of alcohol moving through your brain In the Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin researchers detail a study with 92 men made to go three hours without food then given a shot of either juice or juice with more than a shot of pure alcohol All the glasses were rimmed with alcohol to mask the placebos The men thought they took part in a taste test then did unrelated tasks for 30 minutes After that they were asked to determine whether a series of deliberate accidental or vague stated actions He deleted the email She looked for her keys She tripped on the jump rope etc were deliberate or accidental Ars Technica sums up the results Nearly all the participants no matter what condition judged all the unambiguous statements correctly However when the actions were ambiguous and could have been performed either intentionally or unintentionally the drunk participants were much more likely to perceive the actions as deliberate than the sober participants were The study showed that it didn t much matter whether a man thought he was drunk the jump to conclusions about an intention only took place when someone actually did have too much in them It s a Terrible Sleep Aid Ever heard the term nightcap People have long believed that alcohol helps you get to sleep and that part can be true for some Once you re asleep though alcohol s interaction with your brain can lead to some fitful sleep and no sleep at all especially if you consumed caffeine anytime close to hitting the pillow Image via Ella s Dad Just as with caffeine your brain proves remarkably adept at adapting itself and responding to the ethanol molecules jamming up its receptors and interfering with neuron firings It takes a bit for the brain to catch up though and when your brain starts kicking in and reclaiming all its nooks and crannies it can wreak havoc on your crucial REM sleep along with your more passive general resting If you ve had caffeine too it s a drug that can take up to 5 hours to break down half a dose If it s in your system at the same time as your brain is trying to compensate for alcohol the combined revenge of both drugs can lead to some fairly restless sleep according to Braun s

your brain and body"",""body"":""Alcohol like caffeine has an enormous reputation but loose understanding in popular culture Learn how it s absorbed and how fast why it s essential to reality TV altercations its paradoxical sexual effects and its life lengthening potential whether red wine or Bud Light Image via TheDeliciousLife Everyone it seems takes their cues on how alcohol affects the mind and body from an eclectic mix of knowledge personal experience pop culture tall tales of long nights the latest studies to make the health news wires and second hand tips You might have gathered that alcohol is a depressant that it s dehydrating that you can drink about one drink an hour and stay relatively sober Some of that is true But much of it depends on a large number of factors Let s dig into some of the things we do and don t know about alcohol Relevant sources are linked where cited but much of the background material comes from Buzz The Science and Lore of Alcohol and Caffeine new ish Kindle edition linked there It s a science based tome written in a clear language by Stephen Braun and was the main reference for our take on caffeine We re taking a few things for granted here that you understand some of the basics of alcohol consumption blood alcohol content legal limits what it feels like when you ve had too much to drink and the serious illness of alcoholism We re not trying to help you get loaded quicker or drink more for longer periods We re digging into some of the science behind how you and alcohol interact It Works Differently on Full Stomachs Young Women Some Asians and Aspirin Takers Your body sees alcohol as a poison or at least as something it doesn t actually want inside it To fight back and sober you up humans produce an enzyme called alcohol dehydrogenase That enzyme gets its shot at your alcohol when it attempts to pass through the stomach lining and when it reaches your liver primarily On contact it snatches a hydrogen atom off the ethanol molecules in your drink rendering it into non intoxicating acetaldehyde Humans can then use aldehyde dehydrogenase as a kind of clean up crew breaking down the acetaldehyde that s sometimes considered a cause of hangovers along with dehydration For more on the myths versus reality of hangovers see our guide to hangover cures Image via Wikimedia Commons Seems pretty simple no It s a fight between how much you can drink versus how fast your enzymes can bust down your indulgences and their byproducts But many factors affect certain people s production of the two alcohol crushing compounds Alcohol dehydrogenase AD is for reasons not wholly understood more effective in men than in women Young men in fact may have up to 70 to 80 percent greater enzyme activity in the presence of alcohol But men s AD effectiveness also drops off with age at a faster rate than in women such that by around 55 or 60 men may find themselves able to handle less alcohol than their female counterparts all other factors being equal A full stomach helps break down alcohol but not because your food soaks up the alcohol When you eat a big meal your stomach s pyloric sphincter a kind of release valve into the small intestine closes tightly Your body knows that you ve got food that should get a good going over in your stomach before it heads straight to the high absorption small intestine so it keeps it there and the AD in your stomach has more time to work on the alcohol Drink on an empty stomach and the liquid quickly makes it into the small intestine where there s more than 200 square meters of surface area for absorption into your body Image via peretzpup Another big factor in alcohol absorption and alcohol s effects is genetics Your great great grandparents have a say in how buzzed your Friday night gets for sure but for roughly one third to half of Asian drinkers it s more than a slight variance Alcohol flush reaction a flushing of the face when drinking occurs because the enzyme clean up crew aldehyde dehydrogenase is mutated by just one amino acid That changes how effective its molecules are in bonding with and busting up acetaldehyde With excess acetaldehyde in their system those with a flush reaction get red faced and can experience heart palpitations dizziness and severe nausea in extreme cases Your own genetic makeup of AD and aldehyde dehydrogenase affect your ability to break down alcohol and its byproducts in similar fashion Don t take aspirin before drinking unless you love hangovers Aspirin seriously cuts the effectiveness of your body s AD enzymes In one 1990 study the average blood alcohol levels of those who took two maximum strength aspirin tablets before drinking were an average of 26 percent higher than those who were aspirin free Other studies have suggested even more impact on your body s ability to break down alcohol That also means more acetaldehyde in your system down the line so you ll learn your lesson quickly if you re considering aspirin as a helper Side Note Absorption and Elimination Is a Curve Not a Straight Line Think you ve got a handle on the basic one drink per hour algorithm for your weekend nights Check out this explainer from a forensic toxicology lab which also links up an advanced Blood Alcohol Calculator Your BAC moves through plateaus responds differently to drinks higher than 20 25 percent alcohol by volume and eliminates some alcohol in pure form which is how police can measure it on your breath It Extends Your Life Kind Of Every few weeks it seems a new study suggests a glass of wine or sometimes any old drink lengthens your life if you don t overdo it Plucking just one out of the pile you ll see that in Alcoholism Clinical and Experimental Research researchers followed 1824 people over a total of 20 years as they aged between 55 and 65 Of those who abstained entirely 69 percent died Among those who drank in moderate amounts 41 percent died which was 23 percent less than the light drinkers Even heavy drinkers fared better than abstainers with just 61 percent passing away during the study period How could a substance that everybody and their five brothers tell you to go easy on extend your life Popular theories center on the antioxidants and resveratrol compounds found in wines or on the studies showing alcohol as increasing levels of HDL good cholesterol But Jonah Lehrer at Wired points out the not so obvious the link between a longer life and alcohol may not be direct but it s likely very real It relates to the long term benefits of reducing stress as well as alcohol s role in facilitating get togethers and acting as a social lubricant What does this have to do with longevity In recent years sociologists and epidemiologists have begun studying the long term effects Direct PDF link of loneliness It turns out to be really dangerous We are social primates and when we re cut off from the social network we are more likely to die from just about everything but especially heart disease At this point the link between abstinence and social isolation is merely hypothetical But given the extensive history of group drinking it s what we do when we come together it seems likely that drinking in moderation makes it easier for us develop and nurture relationships And it s these relationships that help keep us alive Image via LINXBAS Theoretically then you might get some of the same benefits if you were a savvy social Diet Coke drinker But it s likely a combination of actual alcohol effects along with their social expressions that leads to study after study showing drinkers as getting some kind of life extending benefit It Doesn t Kill Brain Cells but Does Inhibit Them It s true that at high concentrations like the nearly 100 percent pure alcohol used in sterilizing solutions alcohol can indeed kill cells and neurons and nearly anything else But given that the blood reaching your brain is only at 0 08 percent alcohol if you re legally intoxicated or say 0 25 percent if you ve just closed a major deal in Tokyo it s not doing a lot of damage to your actual brain cells liver cells and other organs with long term chronic abuse are another matter Don t believe it A major study by Grethe Jensen and colleagues in 1993 matched brain samples taken from both alcoholics and nonalcoholics from groups of the two dead from non alcohol related causes There were no significant differences found in either the number or density of brain cells between the groups Misconception Junction tackles Jensen s study and the topic in more depth What alcohol can and does do to your brain is affect the way your neurons get their firing triggers from glutamate It infiltrates the glutamate receptors in your synapses hurting their ability to send off their normal fire messages Alcohol has this impact all across your brain the parts that control muscles speech coordination judgment and so on Keep that in mind the next time you or someone else claims that they drive golf or otherwise perform some task better with alcohol s help As Stephen Braun puts it in Buzz The Science and Lore of Alcohol and Caffeine Substances such as cocaine and LSD work like pharmacological scalpels altering the functioning of only one or a handful of brain circuits Alcohol is more like a pharmacological hand grenade It affects practically everything around it Side Note That s Also Why It Uh Inhibits Sex The studies and implications are numerous to say the least but if you want a thumbnail understanding of how alcohol as Shakespeare put it provokes the desire but takes away the performance it has to do with the firing of nerves in the brain and elsewhere that would relax the arteries enough to get both parties moving It s a bit more complex than that and drinking in moderation can be a net benefit in some cases but alcohol paradoxically doesn t help one specific region of your self to relax Side Note 2 Alcohol is Particularly Effective at Inhibiting Memories Like the sexual response the way the brain makes memories is far from comprehensively understood But it does seem linked to N Methyl D aspartic acid or NMDA the receptor for which alcohol seems particularly adept at interfering with according to Braun Studies have shown that while subjects under alcohol s influence can recall existing memories events happening during inebriation are regularly hard to remember It varies with the amount consumed and seems to top out at a serious 0 2 percent blood alcohol content but anything from flimsy recall to full on blackouts are possible due to alcohol s unique bond with the stuff that should make memories It Makes Other People Seem More Intentional If you d never been raised to think things through you d assume that most actions people took were fairly intentional and possibly pointed at causing you harm The same holds when people are asked to make snap judgments about things happening But give yourself any amount of time and you ll generally think out all the reasons something could have happened avoiding your natural intentionality bias and preventing heated arguments with otherwise close friends bar altercations and 80 percent of all reality show plots Image via terren in Virginia But as you might have guessed that reasoned thinking gets lost when there s a night s worth of alcohol moving through your brain In the Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin researchers detail a study with 92 men made to go three hours without food then given a shot of either juice or juice with more than a shot of pure alcohol All the glasses were rimmed with alcohol to mask the placebos The men thought they took part in a taste test then did unrelated tasks for 30 minutes After that they were asked to determine whether a series of deliberate accidental or vague stated actions He deleted the email She looked for her keys She tripped on the jump rope etc were deliberate or accidental Ars Technica sums up the results Nearly all the participants no matter what condition judged all the unambiguous statements correctly However when the actions were ambiguous and could have been performed either intentionally or unintentionally the drunk participants were much more likely to perceive the actions as deliberate than the sober participants were The study showed that it didn t much matter whether a man thought he was drunk the jump to conclusions about an intention only took place when someone actually did have too much in them It s a Terrible Sleep Aid Ever heard the term nightcap People have long believed that alcohol helps you get to sleep and that part can be true for some Once you re asleep though alcohol s interaction with your brain can lead to some fitful sleep and no sleep at all especially if you consumed caffeine anytime close to hitting the pillow Image via Ella s Dad Just as with caffeine your brain proves remarkably adept at adapting itself and responding to the ethanol molecules jamming up its receptors and interfering with neuron firings It takes a bit for the brain to catch up though and when your brain starts kicking in and reclaiming all its nooks and crannies it can wreak havoc on your crucial REM sleep along with your more passive general resting If you ve had caffeine too it s a drug that can take up to 5 hours to break down half a dose If it s in your system at the same time as your brain is trying to compensate for alcohol the combined revenge of both drugs can lead to some fairly restless sleep according to Braun s

100312"",""title"":""Rethinking Risk Factors for Eating Disorders "",""body"":""by Joann JovinellyThe GistEveryone knows about obvious inherited traits such as eye color height and facial features Less obvious is the fact that you may be at greater risk of developing an eating disorder because of your genes New research published today in the International Journal of Eating Disorders has found that genetics may play a much greater role in who develops an eating disorder than was previously understood Overwhelmingly a condition suffered by young females eating disorders fall into three types anorexia nervosa bulimia nervosa and binge eating disorder and affect up to 24 million Americans Unfortunately many never seek treatment for the disorders of which anorexia poses the most serious health risk Anorexia has a mortality rate that is 18 times higher for females than for those without the disorder according to Dr Hans Christop Steinhausen child and adolescent psychiatrist at the University of Zurich Switzerland Anorexics like others with eating disorders are at a higher than average risk for suicide depression and substance abuse While past examination of eating disorders focused on the impact of environmental factors for example how societies are negatively influenced about body image due to the popularity of thin television and film personalities this new study shows that genetic factors may be just as influential While the media may suggest to everyone that thin is in it appears that some women are much more susceptible to that pressure based on their genetic make up In the Michigan State University study lead researcher Jessica Suisman interviewed 300 sets of female twins between the ages of 12 and 22 Suisman and her team measured how much each person wanted to look like the images of thin celebrities projected from television films and magazines The Expert TakeInitially Suisman was surprised by her findings Shared environmental factors such as exposure to the same media did not have as big an impact as expected she said Instead non shared impacts that make co twins different from each other had the greatest impact Ultimately the broad cultural risk factors that we thought were most influential in the development of thin ideal internalization are not as important as genetic risk she continued Although it has long been established that a broad range of factors influences who develops an eating disorder the new study suggests that those women with mothers who also suffered from the condition are at greater risk of developing it themselves The TakeawayAccording to the National Association of Anorexia Nervosa and Associated Disorders only one in ten people ever seek treatment for eating disorders likely due to the shame associated with the condition New information such as the data provided by the Michigan University study may help those afflicted understand that part of the risk of developing the disease is inherited and therefore out of their control In short it may help more anorexics get the help they need by removing the negative stigma associated with the condition It will also influence physicians to reconsider the risk factors associated with eating disorders in general Michigan State University Professor of Psychology Kelly Klump co author of the 2012 study has been examining the link between eating disorders and genetic inheritability for years In 2007 she authored a similar study that examined 500 14 year old twins and learned that genetic factors that emerge during puberty greatly increase a young woman s chance of developing an eating disorder Source and MethodAccording to lead Michigan State University researcher Suisman once the individual levels of thin idealization were calculated the results from identical twins 100 percent genetic matches were compared with those of fraternal twins 50 percent genetic matches The results concluded that identical twins often shared their desire for a thin body type while fraternal twins were less likely to do so Closer analysis revealed the heritability of thin idealization is 43 percent In other words genetics accounts for nearly half of the reason why some women develop eating disorders while others sharing the same environment do not Other Research The links between genetics and eating disorders has also been the focus of several other recent studies including some that examine endophenotypes non observable mental character traits that link genetics with the development of psychiatric disorders For example possible endophenotypes potentially associated with eating disorders could be a drive for thinness or excessive body dissatisfaction Additional studies of eating disorders focus on specific genetic influences such as genes that may be associated with those conditions According to Suisman It s not just one gene It s not like there s a gene for the thin ideal internalization It s probably many many genes having a small effect And those could be genes that impact people s personalities For example we know that personality characteristics are quite heritable And so maybe it s certain personality characteristics that are heritable and that s what this is capturing For instance perhaps people who are really perfectionistic are more likely to internalize an ideal Other current studies examining eating disorders are focusing on similarities of brain chemistry in those afflicted with the condition such as abnormal serotonin levels new research published today in the international journal of eating disorders has found that genetics may play a much greater role in who develops an eating disorder than was previously understood.

"http://www.theyummylife.com/Natural_Room_Scents"	"10279"	"{""title"":""DIY Natural Room Scents "",""body"":""Here s the thing I m married to a man who hates artificial scents of any kind That goes for air fresheners candles perfume soaps and anything else that is scented We buy unscented everything I could probably buy a car with the money I ve saved on perfume throughout the years of our marriage Turns out that King Man may just be ahead of his time I ve recently been reading about air fresheners and their harmful ingredients Many of them are especially hard on people with allergies and asthma One more thing to stay away from But the air in my house gets stale sometimes Or the day after I ve cooked with garlic that aroma that was so appealing when I was cooking becomes very unpleasant I want to walk into my house and have it smell pleasant Nothing overpowering or even that noticeable Just pleasant There is a simple all natural truly lovely solution That is to fill the air in my home with subtle scents of spices herbs and fruit All I have to do is simmer some sweet smelling ingredients in water The steam fills the air with a pleasant scent Truth is I did this many years ago on the advice of our realtor when we were selling our house Realtors often advise sellers to bake cookies or boil cinnamon water right before a potential buyer drops by That inviting aroma goes a long way to leave a good first impression Why I didn t continue scenting the air in a similar way for our own enjoyment I don t know I ve now got a simple routine going that keeps our house smelling pleasant without staleness or day after garlic odor Keeping the supply list simple I only used items available at the grocery store or in my yard for these scent recipes I want this to be easy and inexpensive so that I can set up a sustainable routine of pleasantly scenting our home These recipes are simply guidelines and don t have to be followed exactly In fact I change them up all the time based on what I have on hand in my kitchen or yard How to Make Natural Room Scents Fragrant items for naturally scenting your home citrus I ve tried other fruits Some of them smell good initially but they don t hold up for more than one use Citrus is sturdier longer lasting and gives these scent recipes freshness Lemons and oranges are particularly fragrant and have the best staying power in these scented waters herbs Any herb can be used for making a room scent but the ones that are sturdier and on woody twigs hold up the best My favorites for room scents are rosemary and thyme pine or cedar twigs needles There may be other fragrant trees that will work too pine and cedar are the two I ve tried for their appealing fresh fragrance extracts A touch of vanilla or almond extract improves most room fragrance mixtures Mint extract has a nice fresh scent spices You can use ground or whole sweet spices The whole spices look prettier if your scented water will be in a location where it will be seen I have found that cinnamon sticks and whole cloves have the most scent staying power Cinnamon sticks can be rinsed off and reused several times They keep on giving Five Natural Room Scent RecipesThese are all scents that my nose likes But scents that are pleasing to one person may not be to someone else Consider how many different scents of perfumes soap and candles there are in stores in an effort to appeal to the masses So use my recipe combos as guidelines that you can tweak and customize to suit what your nose likes General procedure Combine the ingredients in a 2 cup pint jar or container or in a pan on the stove top Cover them with water and heat I ll explain different heating options further down Keep reading view on Amazon pint jars plastic lids for jars Scent 1 Oranges cinnamon cloves allspice and anise are optional This is my favorite both for it s wonderful aroma and for it s staying power This scent carries into multiple rooms better and it can be reheated to scent your rooms for several days Scent 2 Lemon rosemary vanilla A similar scented water is often simmering in Williams Sonoma stores It has a lovely freshness to it Scent 3 Lime thyme mint vanilla extract This combination has such a fresh pleasant scent I initially made it without the mint extract but have found that it really kicks up the aroma Scent 4 Orange ginger fresh or powdered and almond extract This is a sweet delicious scent Scent 5 Pine or cedar twigs or other fragrant twigs bay leaves and nutmeg These scents combine for a complex aroma If you have whole nutmeg use a microplane to grate off the outer surface this will release the scent Add the whole nutmeg piece along with the gratings view on Amazon Microplane Here s the gang of five Aren t they beautiful I like to make these up in pint jars and keep them on hand in the fridge so I m ready to start a pot of simmering scents as needed Uncooked jars will keep in the fridge for several days How to heat the scented mixtures I ve tried a variety of methods and all of these work to varying degrees Some of them provide a more powerful scent than others Just like the air fresheners you buy none of these will scent a whole house but I ll show you some ways to set up individual scent sources in multiple rooms Hopefully you already have what you need to try out one or more of these options Stove top method This is by far the best way I ve found to get the most powerful scent that will spread to more rooms the fastest It s easy as can be Simply combine the ingredients in a pot on the stove bring them to a boil and then lower the heat to a simmer They will immediately begin to scent your kitchen and spread to other rooms How far the scent spreads depends on the size and layout of your house A simmering pot like this makes all four rooms on our first floor smell good The only drawback of this method is that you have to keep a close eye on the water level If the pan dries out you ll be smelling burned citrus instead of sweet fragrant citrus NOTE For a stronger scent simply double or triple the recipe in a larger pot on the stove Uncovered Slow Cooker Method This is my personal favorite for having my house smell pleasant every day I use a mini slow cooker the kind made for keeping dips and sauces warm Mine only has one low heat setting The mixture never actually bubbles and visibly steams I leave it uncovered on my kitchen counter to slowly release scent throughout the day It s subtle but creates a pleasant smell in the house When I m home I keep my mini slow cooker going It s easy and uses very little electricity When I fill mine in the morning it won t dry out for an entire day If you re concerned about accidentally letting it run dry you can put a lamp timer on it so that it automatically shuts off at the desired time I put a scented jar mixture in the microwave for 2 minutes to get it really hot before I add it to the slow cooker That gives it a jump start on releasing the scent NOTE For a stronger scent simply double or triple the recipe in a larger full size slow cooker view on Amazon mini slow cooker on off lamp timer for auto shut off Fondue Pot Method If you have a fondue pot then you have a portable scent station Set it up in any room you d like to scent Below is a small ceramic fondue pot I have that uses a tea light for heat So this will only remain warm as long as the candle lasts 3 1 2 for 4 hours Like the slow cooker this is a low level of heat and releases a very subtle scent enough for a small room Get the scent mixture boiling hot before adding it to the fondue pot I like to set this up in our entry way when we have guests It makes it smell wonderful when you walk through our front door And it looks pretty view on Amazon small ceramic fondue pot Mug Warmer Method I normally keep this little mug warmer next to my computer to keep my coffee and tea warm I ve discovered it also can be used to keep a jar or small bowl of scent mixture warm It only keeps it warm it doesn t actually heat it up So again be sure to heat the mixture before adding it the bowl Or microwave a jar and set it right on top of the mug warmer This low heat puts off a soft scent that is perfect in a bathroom Here s a hint to keep it pretty As the mixtures cook and lose their color they re not as attractive You can spruce it up by floating a fresh slice of citrus on top Or add a few cranberries I keep a bag of them in my freezer they float and add a touch of color view on Amazon electric mug warmer Candle Warmer Method These work just like the mug warmers Candle warmers come with a little bowl on top for melting scented candle pellets Instead you can add some heated scented water Or remove the bowl and set a jar or other bowl on top Note I tested the temperatures of these with a thermometer The mug warmer and candle warmer both kept the mixture at about 120 F That s enough to let off a very subtle scent but don t expect these to strongly scent a big room You need more heat and steam for a stronger scent view on Amazon ceramic electric candle warmer Tea Pot Warmer Method My tea pot warmer also uses tea lights I can put two or three tea lights in mine to achieve the temperature I want These only last as long as the tea lights burn but they can get hotter than the mug and candle warmers thus releasing more scent I can put a bowl or jar on top of my tea pot warmer as long as I put it somewhere that I can keep an eye on it I don t like to leave candles unattended view on Amazon cast iron teapot warmer Add more hot water as needed As the water evaporates from any of these warming bowls or jars top it off with additional HOT water It needs to be hot when it s added so that it doesn t cool down the temperature of the scented water Higher heat more fragrance Gift them These make a fun unique hostess gift Take one along to a party as a gift for your host that can be simmered and enjoyed the next day Reuse each mixture 2 3 times After these have been heated and simmered for awhile the water becomes cloudy as you can see in the jars below and some of the ingredients lose their vibrant color Although they don t look as pretty they still smell good Usually you can reheat and simmer these again 2 3 times Jar them up and refrigerate them between uses Open the jar and give it the sniff test if it still smells good reheat and reuse it Add more water as needed Cost saving tips You can save use and reuse a number of fragrant ingredients These scents don t need to be expensive Leftover ginger If you ever cook with fresh ginger and end up with leftover pieces this is a way to use them up before they spoil Slice the leftover ginger and freeze it in a bag or container to have on hand for whipping up a quick batch of scented water Save your orange peels When you eat an orange save the peel for use in scented waters Store them in the refrigerator or freezer until you need them Save your juiced lemons and limes After you ve juiced these for use in a recipe refrigerate or freeze the leftover pieces Save your leftover herbs If you have herbs in a garden or have leftover herbs that you ve purchased for cooking they can be frozen and saved for use in these scented waters Use expired juices If you have fruit juices that are past their prime use them as a base in place of the water in these mixtures They re both fragrant and colorful Use expired spices Spices are supposed to be replaced after a year because they lose much of their flavor But they still smell good Instead of throwing out old spices use them for scenting water There are endless combinations for these scented waters If you have some additional ideas please share I m always looking for a new pleasant scent for my home Oh and good news King Man likes these natural scents Happy husband happy home Make it Yummy day Monica Natural Room Scents By Monica Ingredients Citrus sliced lemons oranges limes may use

a turtle neck and a scarf to cover my mouth and nose but when I returned home I kept feeling like I was going to catch a cold for a week When it finally manifested it was by way of my sinus cavity and throat with a dry cough I took an over the counter med and Motrin and was still miserable I finally could not take it any more and typed in cures for sinus in my computers search engine and your site was at the top of the list When I clicked on the site the testimonial page popped up first In Los Angeles we have a store called Yummy com that delivers organic groceries On their website they didn t

Paradise California Usa replies First of all it had to have been 2 drops because that is the way O of Oregano is normally recommended by a drop at a time Second it has to be diluted by olive oil or another carrier oil if it was concentrated That is very important If you buy it at a store make sure if it is already diluted or if you need to dilute it It works wonders for many things I use 2 drops on my toothbrush and have saved myself hundreds of dollars at the dentist 02 11 2011 June from Pasadena California replies Hi Linny I have taken large quantities of oregano oil when I ve been sick and never had any side effects I took 3 4 supercritical capsules at at time and up to 4 doses a day I currently have oregano leaf herbal extract in my cupboard and just looked up the dosage on the bottle after reading your thread it says 30 40 drops per dose Not sure what kind of Oregano leaf oil you were taking but I think you ll be okay 03 19 2011 Marta from Louisa Va replies Linny Thanks for the warning correction June the 100 pure undiluted organo oil origanum vulgare is wayyyy strong It s very different from pills or extract which is not as strong Still great and useful but the pure essential oil burns even on your skin if undiluted The 1 2 drops of the oil is the safe way to do it diluted in something else Hope this is helpful and thank you for the tips AJWAIN SEEDS BETTER BUT

nagging presumption that your headache is a stroke I thought about all the things you think about when you think this night is your last my beautiful kids growing up without my ineradicable bad habits I grew furious about certain facts of my life debt unemployment poor health insurance and vowed to do everything I could to change these facts if it turned out that I was not in fact in the middle of dying Then I came downstairs and tried some alternatives to morbid insomnia and I wound up pouring myself three cups of warm water with some apple cider vinegar My sinuses have cleared and with it my splitting headache My insomnia remains but I can live with that Replies YEA 11 02 2010 Arsieiuni from Arley Al United States Of America replies I drank the suggested 2TBS ACV in 8OZ water last night

up although my right ear is still somewhat plugged But my sinuses are still congested although I don t have any nasal discharge and nothing comes out when I blow my nose I have been taking the unfiltered ACV 2TB in warm water with honey 2X daily for two days now I do notice some mucus coming from my mouth several times a day but it doesn t feel like it s working on my sinuses Is it common

it It stung a little Ok maybe a lot at times but after I let it out of my sinus I started sneezing like crazy After I was done I could breath clear out of both nostrils Does not last but when I started doing it I couldn t get it to come out the other nostril and now I can with some patience Good luck 04 14 2011 Nicole from Coquitlam Bc Canada replies Kathy I am suffering with the same thing I was at the doctor yesterday and informed that after a nasty sinus infection the sinuses can swell No matter how much I blow my nose I still feel pressure up in the sinus area This is due to the swelling I was given a perscription for a nasal spray which will reduce inflamation but am looking at other options to help with congestion It has been about 8 weeks of sinus problems I just want a break I have just started the spray so we will see YEA 01 24 2010 Michael from Las Vegas Nevada Usa writes hello Ive been suffering from congestion in my chest nose for the past 4 days I tried the acv

to be congesting me even more and I couldn t sleep more then 2 hrs at a time So I jumped on the web and looked up natural remedies and came across this website I didn t have all or any of the ingredients to make the spicy tomato drink So I went to the next remedy I could find on the site Its now 4 20 am and I can breath now I live alone so i don t have measuring spoons cups so I just put 2

recommend it I am even doing ACV inhalations I have only been on it one day but so far results have been very promising YEA 12 03 2009 Julieann110 from Alexandria Va USA writes I have had severe head congestion for nearly a week now and the over the counter stuff isn t working much I just tried two swigs of ACV and wow The relief is instant Much like eating spicy foods I suspect the amount of relief one gets is directly related to how diluted or not diluted the ACV really is QUESTION 09 03 2009 Ranjana from Arlington Tx Usa writes If one has severe sinus congestion and starting to run a low grade fever is it too late to rely on ACV Is it time for antibiotics or can ACV still cure it Thanks YEA 06 16 2009 Sara M from Cedar Rapids IA writes ACV and Sinus congestion Holy heck In

because of it I ve tried five kinds of over the counter cold and sinus medicines and nothing phased it I just drank a glass of water with 2 5 tablespoons of apple cider vinegar and now I m able to breathe freely The effect was immediate Thank you so much This site has been very helpful to me Replies YEA 04 20 2009 Hoss from Galloway OH replies Belinda your posting could have been me I ve been to the doc twice with 2 different prescriptions for antibiotics and then when my congestion got so bad that I couldn t breathe out of either nostril then I went to the pharmacy to buy over the counter drugs I even talked with the pharmacist as what I should take Nothing seemed to help and I was down to just one day of antibiotics left I thought I should probably go see my doc again Then for the heck of it I went online and typed in severe nasal congestion and found this website I had some apple cider vinegar in the basement so I got it out and mixed 2 5 tablespoons with an 8 oz glass of ice water I wasn t sure if I could drink it but it wasn t too bad a little bitter like lemon or limes It was amazing within an hour both my nostrils were open and I could breathe I fixed another glass to sit by my beside during the night and if I got up to go to the bathroom or simply started coughing I d take a little sip I slept the best last night that I have in over a week and I didn t elevate my head to help me breathe I m not sure how drinking this gets up to my sinuses but it surely seems to work and I was a big skeptic Thank you YEA 01 17 2009 Terra from Wayne Michigan writes Thank

fruit every time he steps outdoors However the parts of that story concerning idiots were uninteresting to me given my heavy exposure to idiots on the Internet already What sparked my imagination was the idea of a madman working on antiquated methods of transportation in his backyard and getting his children to test them like they were monkeys or something Truthfully I was amazed I hadn t thought of it myself Children share many of the same characteristics of monkeys in that they re trainable lightweight and love bananas However unlike monkeys few people actually care about the welfare of children making them ideally suited for such dangerous work I have to applaud the boy s father s genius Sending children into the sky in wacky Victorian modes of transport would make for incredible TV Hell we just watched it make for incredible TV Someone get on this Because no one ever gets on something when I ask them to I decided to do a bit of research on this myself Below are 18 of the most preposterous methods of transport I could find It turns out that many of these are hilarious even independent of their ability to endanger children The downside with conventional hot air balloons is

chocolate type dish that was crumbled up I grabbed a piece ate it had eight more pieces and then went on a mad hunt throughout the barbeque to see who brought the stuff and how much I would have to pay them for the recipe After not too much work I tracked it down and trust me You want to make this This will blow your mind What s fantastic about this stuff is many things First it marries salty and sweet perfectly which is my favorite Second it is super easy to make Third it is best kept and eaten frozen so it is awesome for summer time Brickle Yield Serves 8 10 Prep Time 20 minutes Total Time 5 hours Ingredients 40 Saltine crackers one sleeve about 1 Cup salted butter don t substitute 1 Cup brown sugar1 12 ounce package of chocolate chips5 6 Heath bars crunched up for topping Directions 1 Line a rimmed baking sheet with foil 2 Then layer in crackers Make sure that they don t overlap 3 Melt the butter in a saucepan and then stir in the brown sugar Once it starts bubbling turn the heat to medium low and simmer for 3 minutes Stir continuously or it might burn 4 Once it has simmered for a few minutes pour it straight on the crackers Try to get it kind of even but don t worry about covering everything 5 Next stick your baking sheet in the oven at 325 degrees for 5 10 minutes The original recipe called for 5 minutes but mine took 10 Basically you want the caramel to spread out nicely over the crackers It should bubble a bit 6 When you take it out of the oven pour the chocolate chips on the tray right away The residual heat from the oven will be more than enough to melt the chocolate Let it sit for 5 minutes to melt 7 Meanwhile crumble up some heath bars 8 After 5 minutes use a spatula to spread out the chocolate and make the chips flat Then sprinkle on the Heath pieces 9 Then just stick this whole thing in the freezer You have to make sure you give this stuff time to freeze solid I let mine sit for about 4 hours in there and that was more than enough time 10 Then take it out and if the brickle is rock hard flip it over and peel of the foil which should come off in one full sheet 11 Then just bust the stuff up Take out some aggression One note though make sure you take the foil off before you break it up That is unless your idea of a good time is peeling hundreds of tiny foil pieces off of candy 12 Store this stuff in the freezer It will keep for a month This is all you need The Saltine crackers are the key to the saltiness and they are kind of hard to identify in the final product because it is all broken up Simple ingredients actually The next part is simple Take your largest sheet or baking tray make sure it is rimmed and line it with foil Then toss down your crackers Make sure that they don t overlap That s pretty much the only rule The crackers should fill up the baking sheet perfectly If you have a smaller baking sheet then you will obviously need less crackers Crackers laid out Ok Now the only actual hard part in the whole recipe and it isn t that hard making the caramel Just melt your butter in a saucepan and then stir in your brown sugar Once it starts bubbling turn the heat to medium low and simmer for 3 minutes Stir continuously or it might burn Stay close to this stuff The caramel will be pretty runny and that is good Once it has simmered for a few minutes pour it straight on the crackers Try to get it kind of even but don t worry about covering everything Doesn t have to be even Next stick your baking sheet in the oven at 325 degrees for 5 10 minutes The original recipe called for 5 minutes but mine took 10 Basically you want the caramel to spread out nicely over the crackers It should bubble a bit When you take it out of the oven pour your chocolate chips on the tray right away The residual heat from the oven will be more than enough to melt the chocolate Let it sit for 5 minutes to melt Don t worry it will all melt You can use those 5 minutes while the chocolate melts to crumble up your Heath bars Again don t worry about making them even or anything Part of the charm of this dish is the random sizes of everything After 5 minutes use a spatula to spread out your chocolate and make the chips flat Then sprinkle on your Heath pieces Perfection is not essential Then just stick this whole thing in your freezer You have to make sure you give this stuff time to freeze solid I let mine sit for about 4 hours in there and that was more than enough time Then take it out and if your brickle is rock hard flip it over and peel of the foil which should come off in one full sheet Cool Then just bust the stuff up Take out some aggression One note though make sure you take the foil off before you break it up That is unless your idea of a good time is peeling hundreds of tiny foil pieces off of candy Um Yes please Store this stuff in the freezer It will keep for a month I m sure Not that anyone has ever actually let it sit that long Mine was gone in a few days without any problem at all This will go quick at parties An easy recipe and a delicious dessert It s a perfect dessert for a party Make the brickle Eat the brickle Share the brickle Love the brickle a few weeks ago, i went to a

percent algal fuels could cut oil imports 17 percent"",""body"":""Forget hydrogen Algae may be the fuel of the future A study by researchers at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory finds algal fuel could replace 17 percent of the petroleum the United States imports for transportation fuel each year Of course one of the major concerns about algae is the volume of water needed to produce it But the researchers note that water use can be significantly curtailed by raising algae in the humid climates of the Gulf Coast Southeastern Seaboard and Great Lakes regions Algae has been a hot topic of biofuel discussions recently but no one has taken such a detailed look at how much America could make and how much water and land it would require until now said Mark Wigmosta a hydrologist and lead author of the study in a statement This research provides the groundwork and initial estimates needed to better inform renewable energy decisions Algal fuels are made by extracting and refining the lipids within algae Algae are attractive biofuel feedstock because it grows quickly and thrives in everything from seawater to irrigation runoff to sewage Such fuels could go a long way toward meeting the Energy Independence and Security Act That law requires that biofuels replace more than 10 percent of our current petroleum consumption by 2022 Half of that biofuel must come from something other than corn The PNNL study provides an in depth assessment of the United States annual algal fuel potential given the available land and water The researchers who detail their findings in Water Resources Research analyzed currently available data to determine how much algae can be grown in open outdoor ponds of fresh water as is typical using current tech First they created a database analyzing topography population land use and other data about the contiguous United States The info spaced every 100 feet allowed them to determine which areas are ideally suited to raising algae Then they gathered 30 years of weather info to determine how much sunlight the algae could realistically photosynthesize and how warm the ponds would become They used that data in a mathematical model to calculate how much algae could be produced each hour at a given site Using that model they say 21 billion gallons of algal oil could be produced domestically That s equivalent to 17 percent of the petroleum the United States imported for transportation fuel in 2008 Growing all that algae would require land roughly the size of South Carolina and 350 gallons of water for each gallon of algal oil All told that comes to about 25 percent of the water we currently use for crop irrigation The researchers say that s on par with ethanol Water is an important consideration when choosing a biofuel source Wigmosta said And so are many other factors Algae could be part of the solution to the nation s energy puzzle if we re smart about where we place growth ponds and the technical challenges to achieving commercial scale algal biofuel production are met If we went for broke and maxed out our capacity to produce algae we could cut petroleum imports by 48 percent the researchers say But we d need several times our annual consumption of irrigation water to do so It isn t terribly practical John Timmer a biochemist who writes for our sister publication Ars Techica offers some interesting analysis of the study He says the 48 percent figure is based on unrealistic assumptions Even the possibility of replacing 17 percent of our oil imports with algal fuel must be taken with a grain of salt Even for the more realistic scenarios the list of caveats is pretty extensive he writes Water and nutrients are unlimited only evaporation is considered only open ponds are used and the authors ignore the energy demand involved in keeping the ponds from freezing or processing the algae into fuel The authors identified areas that could be used for open ponds and focused on land that is relatively flat and isn t farmland or parkland That includes roughly 5 percent of the country s land If we used it all for biofuel production we could produce 220 gigaliters a year or about half our current oil imports Timmer writes But we don t have the water needed to do that With that in mind Timmer writes the researchers balance productivity and water requirements That left the Gulf Coast Southeast Seaboard and Great Lakes as ideal locations And that led them to conclude we could replace 17 percent of our imported oil while consuming one quarter of the water used each year for agriculture irrigation That s still quite high but remember that this assumes unpolluted freshwater Timmer writes The areas along the Gulf and Atlantic cost could easily use a combination of saltwater and municipal waste The latter source could potentially provide for facilities in some of the areas in the Southwest that are otherwise ruled out due to their high water use Such details were beyond the scope of the PNNL study but critical to consider Timmer writes The authors hope other researchers use their model to conduct further studies Ideally if they re taken up on this offer Timmer writes

night Eric and I got dressed up me as the Queen of Hearts him as the Scream character and we stuffed 40 treat bags for the trick or treaters They were bursting with candy and small toys like leap frogs and mini games Last year we got around 20 kids so we doubled the quantity in case there was an influx of kids We did it up Halloween music was pumping through the upstairs window and our black light was flashing A mild headache ensued My poufy sleeves really started to itch my arms but I persisted on and had another sip of my spiked cider Eric said he couldn t breathe through his mask removing it every once and a while to gasp for air No biggie Then we waited And you know what Not one kid came to our door What has the world come to these days Are there no kids trick or treating anymore It was like a ghost town out there Needless to say Eric s coworkers will be overjoyed when they see all the treat bags he s brought them today I don t think anyone is getting much work done today unless buzzing around the office on a sugar high and playing leap frog counts Luckily we had this soup to comfort us last night The Queen of Hearts and Scream characters sat at the table and enjoyed a delicious bowl of soup and crispy garlic bread Sometimes that s all you need I ve made this soup twice in one week and the second time I doubled the recipe after deeming the first version produced too little soup I posted the doubled recipe below If you re a mushroom fan you will go crazy for this meaty and ultra hearty soup It honestly makes me drool to look at these pictures because I love it so much Normal right Saut\u00e9 some garlic and onion for about 5 minutes Don t all amazing recipes start this way Then add in your sliced mushrooms and cook it down for about 15 20 minutes Meanwhile cook some millet in a pot Quinoa would also work nicely too Add your broth seasonings and simmer for about 5 more minutes At this point I scooped half of my soup into the blender and processed it until lightly smooth Then I poured this mixture back into the pot with the remaining soup I loved this method because it thickens up the soup very nicely but still left big mushroom pieces to bite into Of course if you have a hand held immersion blender that would work even better a food processor would work too but be sure to leave it chunky for the best texture Now stir in the cooked millet This thickens it up nicely too And you re done Feel free to spoon into mason jars for portable work lunches I also made some Cheezy garlic bread based off a recipe in Eat Drink Be Vegan To make Slice a baguette in halfPeel a garlic clove and cut it in half and rub the garlic all over the bread This helps infuse the garlic flavour into the bread without it being overpowering You can also use garlic powder or garlic salt Spread on some Earth Balance or other non dairy spread Followed by a sprinkle of nutritional yeast for the cheezy flavour and kosher saltBake at 350F for about 14 15 minutes until crispy and golden Slice serve warm This was amazing I don t even want to tell you how many pieces I had I think I ploughed through a quarter of the baguette Why are baguettes so insanely good By the way my tests came back normal so gluten is here to stay I ll be talking about this more in a future post though Mushroom Millet Soup Vegan Gluten Free Low fat Hearty meaty and filling pair this with homemade garlic bread and you ve got a healthy Fall meal that will make you forget all about summer Yield Approx 7 cupsIngredients 1 cup uncooked millet or quinoa for complete protein 2 pounds fresh cremini mushrooms sliced4 cups chopped sweet onion4 garlic cloves minced7 5 cups low sodium vegetable broth if using full sodium reduce added salt below Salt pepper to taste I used about 1 5 tsp kosher salt 2 tbsp vegan GF Wizard s Worchester sauce or equivalent To garnish toasted walnuts fresh herbs etc 1 Preheat oven to 350F Line a baking sheet with parchment paper 2 Prepare your millet I used these directions and fluff with a fork and set aside 3 Meanwhile in a large pot over medium low heat add a bit of oil 1 tsp along with the chopped onion and minced garlic Sautee for about 5 minutes until transparent stirring frequently 4 Stir in broth along with seasonings salt pepper Worchester sauce Add only about half of the salt to begin adding the rest to taste right before serving Simmer over medium heat for about 5 minutes 5 Scoop half of the mixture into a blender and blend until almost smooth but still a bit chunky Add back into the pot Alternatively you can use an immersion blender but be sure to leave it nice and chunky 6 Stir in cooked millet Season to taste and serve with a garnish of toasted walnuts garlic bread fresh parsley or anything that you like Late last night we headed out for our evening walk A nice older lady who lives down the street had made a cute Halloween display for the kids at the end of her driveway There was a sign taped to a haystack that read Please help yourself to the candy but no candy to be found We walked down the road a bit and there was a RACCOON with her bowl of candy happily munching away on a Snickers bar in front of her yard At least someone s enjoying Halloween imagine this scene: last night, eric and i got dressed up (me as the queen of hearts, him as the scream character) and we stuffed 40 treat bags

time I ve bought my PS3 and all the accessories and a couple games and a big ass TV that can properly display them I m down for four times that amount Enough to eat breakfast and lunch for a year Enough to get a used car that runs We ve put the money down but now we ve got a few demands 1 Give us A I that will actually outsmart us now and then Look at the little guy The one on the left The one who s just a head I mean let s face it strategy is all that guy s got going for him He has no limbs and he s already on fire Yet in Doom III the bad guys were flailing at us with the same straight line Ulysses S Grant calvary charge that failed them twelve years earlier in Doom Far Cry had bad guys that went into spinning seizures when they got confused Crysis is better yet enemies will still stand stupidly by while their friends are gunned down in their field of vision These days we get so overjoyed every time an enemy actually shoots from cover in a game that we forgive the fact that real advanced A I is as much an unfulfilled promise as the flying car Where are the FPS bad guys who can adapt their strategy on the fly Enemies who themselves have six different guns and switch up according to what the situation calls for Bad guys who work in teams who strategize who create diversions to distract you Where s the enemy Solid Snake who sneaks up on you with the silence of a ninja s church fart Do NOT duck inside those doors men Honorable warriors need no cover Chances of that happening Almost zero One there s more and more focus on multiplayer for this sort of game This takes some of the pressure off programmers because in multiplayer other humans supply their own A I Even the ones who are complete morons Two as developers have lamented the guts of the new consoles are geared to make the gaming equivalent of dumb blondes It has to do with the fact that both the XBox 360 and the PS3 s Cell CPU use in order processing which to greatly simplify means they ve intentionally crippled the ability to make clever A I and dynamic unpredictable wide open games in favor of beautiful water reflections and explosion debris that flies through the air prettily That means a generation of games will likely play just like the last generation Only shiny 2 Don t bullshit me about your graphics How can there still be gamers taken in by EXCLUSIVE SCREENSHOTS of games that are obviously taken from cutscenes and have NO connection with what the actual game will look like I blame the developers formerly known as Square for this They re the ones who back in the day ran their entire ad campaign for Final Fantasy VIII with shots like this for a game that looked like this Now that was a great game and the actual game looked fine for its time But stop treating us like morons Yet when the 360 arrived years later sites were trumpeting EXCLUSIVE SCREENSHOTS OF PERFECT DARK that looked like this Drool Wow This must be one of those new second person shooters we ve been hearing about where you spend the whole game looking at the hero s fucking eye Because surely from now on they ll demonstrate the awesomeness of their game only with shots from the game right Chances of that happening are directly proportional to whether or not you ll stop falling for it 3 Nipples Speaking of adult games where are they Politicians bemoan the bloodthirsty horror of video games but really the standards are almost Victorian when compared to R rated Hollywood fare such as Sin City and Kill Bill and Cinemax s Voyeur Safari IV Dildo Island You get a little harsh language and some comic booky sprays of gore but that s about it There is an AO Adults Only ESRB rating for games but when is the last time you saw it We re not for speeding the moral degradation of the modern world but imagine a Hollywood where only PG 13 movies could get made Say goodbye to everything from Shindler s List to The Matrix Chances of that happening We ve got one hyphenated word for you Wal Mart The largest game seller in the world simply won t stock games with the AO rating Period So those games won t sell and developers won t make them So until they invent new and varied and Wal Martless ways to sell the games we re stuck with the AO games found only in our fantasies 4 And on the opposite side of the nipple coin Developers will be shocked one day when they notice that the world is full of women It s true More than half of your potential customer base are penisless They have money They like doing fun things And yet how do you think they feel when they play a game where the heroine looks like this Yeah that s what she wears into battle Thong length kimono no bra for those flopping DDD breasts And this is years after analysts told developers that women would happily play games if they didn t feel so objectified by them and several decades past the point where they should have even needed to be told that Have you guys ever met a woman Then why don t you try making just a few games that don t play off of a 14 year old male s idea of womanhood on the apparent hope that he ll play the game one handed Chances of that happening Sadly the proven money making designers in the industry are the same ones that have given us Dead Or Alive Beach Volleyball and Grand Theft Auto Vice City where the main character rampages though a city populated with violent men and sex crazed street whores As it turns out they re all men The female demographic is seen as something that can be targeted by adding features to existing games such as in game clothes shopping in game makeup application and in game cute animal pets Game creators aren t just casually missing the point they re showing a unified front of stupidity There is hope however Like all industry it is inevitable that females will eventually forge their place in the world of game design The female designers will burst on the scene soon enough heaving their giant bosoms of talent and creativity and brandishing their black thongs of diversity 5 Don t bullshit us on the difficulty Gradually tougher enemies more enemies mind bending puzzles it s all good It s all fair But DO NOT try to artificially make your game harder with Arbitrary triggers in RPG s Why isn t the Dark Elf waiting at the Black Temple like he said Because I haven t talked to every fucking person in town yet Can we at least write in some kind of actual cause and effect here that might make some kind of actual sense to me Because I don t get any sense of reward or accomplishment by randomly activating subroutines via mind numbing repetition Ammo starvation I m looking at you Resident Evil series I have a gun LET ME USE IT Don t pretend your game is challenging because you only give me four bullets to kill eight zombie dogs with Confusing mapless floor plans Did you remember when you were a kid and you got bored on weekends how you would go to a large building a hotel or a hospital then wander around for several hours looking for a certain room While zombies attacked you Neither do we That s because much to the surprise of FPS game makers everywhere wandering around lost in hallways isn t fun If you game wizards are so proud of your sprawling levels and alternate routes GIVE ME A MAP OF THE LEVEL If I m not playing to have fun then why the fuck do you think I m playing Instant Failure Stealth Levels Ack This brings back horrible decade old memories of a Goldeneye level where if you tripped an alarm an infinite number of bad guys poured forth We knew a man who failed that level 37 times then got the Infinite Health cheat for it and came back He intentionally tripped the alarm the guards rushed out Laughing maniacally he proceeded to shoot those fuckers for four hours killing 1 183 of them 682 with groin shots before his thumbs cramped up Your game should not create this kind of bitterness Unnecessarily difficult end levels I ve worked for 50 hours to get to this point in the game Don t make me watch the Loading screen and then the fucking climactic cutscene 75 times once for each attempt to beat the last boss And don t make the method of attack so fucking obscure and specific that nothing short of a trip to GameFaqs will get me through it Talk about killing immersion Speed Cheating That miraculous burst of catch up speed from your opponents CPU tacklers and recievers do it in Madden I m also looking at you every racing game ever made Hard games are fine We like a challenge But be fair about it Chances of that happening Remember that all of this is a method for extending the life of a too short game So ask yourself this do games seem to be getting longer or shorter And as games get more expensive to produce do you expect them to have more levels or fewer The shorter the games the more they re tempted try to extend the playing experience via arbitrary infuriating obstacles 6 Don t bullshit us on the game s features Marine we need you to head to the depths of the compound to rescue a scientist that is being held hostage by Satan and his manyfold minions Here s your pistol and eight rounds of ammunition Good luck What law says I have to start out the game with none of the fun shit promised on the box art Again is this not just a cheap way of extending the life of the game In FPS games built entirely on the anticipation of using gigantic phallic symbol weapons why not start me out with a damned machine gun and 200 rounds of ammo and go up from there Racing games pull this too Why do I have to spend 40 hours driving a minivan just to get enough money to buy a Honda Civic Why can t I have access to all of the content right away What if I don t feel any satisfaction in unlocking the game features I already paid real life money for and just want to fucking race the Ferrari on the box art Chances of that happening See 6 Though I want to give a shout out to the Metroid Prime games for giving us infinite ammo on the default gun Think about how your life would have been different if your gun had never run out of bullets my friend You wouldn t be in that Mexican jail right now I can tell you that How in the name of Islamic Fonzie did we ever let games get away with Loading screens The Gamecube didn t even have those not on the games made by Nintendo Hell the 8 bit NES didn t have load screens 20 years ago Our favorite TV shows don t load DVD movies don t load between scenes The animals at the zoo don t load Yes the hardware can do it But developers don t think it s important Think of it this way When you re bored at work what do you play Solitaire Why Because you don t have to spend 5 minutes looking for a CD ROM 5 minutes watching corporate logos and 5 minutes watching load screens You click and you play Game designers We re really busy Lots of us got kids now and second jobs and mistresses on the side You want to sell your console games to the millions of people who are lucky to get 30 uninterrupted minutes to play a game Fix this first Chances of that happening The problem is a little thing we like to call copy protection Even the consoles with hard drives won t let us install the game on there for fear of us then passing the disc on to a friend especially if said friend works the return counter at the store we bought the game from But surely the video game industry will have to find another way because every time I see a load screen I alllllmost have time to start reading a book This is why the Wii is sucking away all your market share guys They ve built it with no commitment click and play games in mind 8 No more save points When we re on our deathbeds we re going to wish we could reclaim the time we spent wandering around for save points long after we were done playing every night Imagine if your word processing program did this refusing to let you save your progress until you typed six more paragraphs Or made you retype your last paragraph six times while zombies tried to shoot your cursor The analogy sort of breaks down there but the point is we shouldn t ever see a save point in a game again Limited saves were invented for consoles that didn t have the memory to let you quicksave where you can save at any time any where with one keystroke like on a PC To keep that physical limitation and pretend it s a gameplay element is like Superman 64 claiming its programmers inability to render any background scenery was Kryptonite Fog There is not one single reason in the known universe for even one more game where the save point is ten motherfucking minutes away from the boss forcing me to fight my way down the same hallway each of the 62 attempts it takes me to beat the guy I m looking at you Metroid Prime Chances of that happening The XBox port of Doom III let you quicksave It can be done at least for those of us with hard drives Surely the gaming industry will hear our concerns and act accordingly 9 Immersion and the invisible hand of God If pretty graphics are king it s time to remember what pretty graphics are for immersion Immersion means soothing to sleep the part of our brain that remembers we re not intergalactic bounty hunters or world class athletes And that part of us is rudely jostled awake when our snowboarder bounces off an invisible wall in midair Boink Wait a second I m a virgin because he strayed from the race area I understand you can t have infinite space guys surfing right off the mountain and taking a snowboard tour of Asia But put a cliff there Cliffs are solid Empty air is not solid Almost every game does this In the Lord of the Rings Return of the King game there s actually a run out of a crumbling building level where stones rain down on your head and block your path So the biggest difficulty in the level is that you can t jump over a knee high stone because THERE IS NO FUCKING JUMPING IN THE GAME Game makers it doesn t have to be a jumping game for you to give the characters the basic ability to jump low obstacles that all humans have And when I walk up to little ledges that are 10 inches off the ground a ledge a toddler could crawl over and you arbitrarily don t let me pass because it s not a jumping game you remind me of what I m really doing playing a game We re to the stage where it should be a minimum requirement in the game universe rock should act like rock air should act like air and humans should move like humans Chances of that happening The new hardware can certainly handle it realistic physics are part of the chunky graphics stew the new games are so good at brewing This should only get better unless as I suspect the game makers secretly hate us 10 And while we re at it Let s rid games of all arbitrary barriers Don t show my character casting magic meteors that smash mountains in one scene and in the next send me all over the dungeon trying to find a single key to a rickety wooden door that looks like it could be knocked in with a strong shoulder Make it a magic door a huge door fine but don t make it an arbitrary door that only remains closed because that s what the plot requires Also don t have me toting around 500 pounds of high explosives 2 different kinds of missile launchers and a nuclear fusion cannon and still make almost every pane of glass I come across totally unbreakable It was cute that I could shoot Coke cans off the tables in Doom III But then I shoot the magazine sitting next to it and it doesn t even show scuff marks Give me environments that realistically react to what I do Yes it matters It s immersion bitch Chances of that happening Actually pretty good The fact is that breaking glass looks very pretty in a game and it undeniably appeals to the vandal that lurks in the heart of every single teenage boy Realistic models of entire houses instead of say just a hallway are entirely possible now And that impassible rickety old door way will soon be the high resolution animated magical force field a feature that already appeared in Half Life 2 thank you very much bzzzzzzzzzzzt 11 And while we re still at it Let s ban all IAC s Immersion annihilating contrivances These include Superimposing shit on the screen And by shit we mean words Fatal Frame 2 was one of the most awesomely atmospheric games ever made until you took a snapshot of the second ghost and the words CORE SHOT 396pts popped up Spooooooky Mr Frodo Is that you behind ORC HEWER Cinematic camera angles No thank you Understand that we need to see what our character sees As soon as you start panning the camera around Mario for no better reason than to see the pretty sunset on the distance we lose control And here s another tip If you have a single level where the player s character is required to run toward the camera send the fucker back for more programming because you re not done yet Shitty voice acting When it s good it s great when it s bad it will haunt your nightmares for years Isn t the world full of unemployed actors willing to do voice work in exchange for food or you know Heroin Do it with feeling this time Cody and I ll make the spiders in your brain go away Chances of that happening The cameras in 3D games have actually gotten worse Mario Sunshine s camera system wasn t half as smooth as Mario 64 s for instance because in the game making world camera and player controls are decided on after the game s pretty artwork When 3D games were new the only question was how can we make the controls as responsive and fluid as 2D Now it s how can we show off these really cool looking trees That s what the little sons of bitches care about In short the first 3D games were designed around their cameras now they re designed around their graphics As far as shitty voice acting one voice acting doesn t sell games Both Eternal Darkness and Grim Fandango had wonderful acting with accents and everything Combined those two games sold 278 copies So if we really care that the rendered dragon in the cutscene sounded suspiciously like a high school drama student we re not showing it in our buying decisions Also remember that these cutscenes have to be dubbed in several languages English and Japanese at the very least and it s done with ONE set of animated lips They don t re draw the whole damned thing just to dub it So you get the awkward situation where the poor voice actor is trying to match the lip movements to a line that was animated in Japanese and that s probably even harder than it sounds 12 Seriously get rid of the crates The crate has long been held up as an example of lazy game art design a crutch that game level decorators have been falling back on for fifteen damned years Come to think of it have you ever actually seen one of those wooden crates in real life And did you smash it to see if there were bullets and medicine inside But here we use the crate as a symbol for all lazy recycled game design Of course there s some innovative stuff out there but for every one of those there seem to be 30 games that are for instance set against the backdrop of a post apocalyptic future I understand that lots of game designers remember the futuristic cyborg movies of their childhood But remember the only reason those films took place in an apocalyptic future is because it was cheaper to film in a burned out factory than to build actual futuristic sets Games should have no such limitation Use your imagination guys Chances of that happening Well the technology really is getting amazing now Look at how gorgeous the textures are on this shot from Half Life 2 I mean that s actual wood grain there That looks like you could reach out and actually get a splinter from that crate And look at Quake 4 for the 360 I mean that crate has been upgraded with a wicked awesome skull on it Though I guess it could just be a box full of skulls 13 Stop the Short Sighted Business Bullshit Patents Did you know there s a patent held by some microscopic software company on spherical camera controls in realtime 3D and they re starting to level lawsuits against EVERYONE Did you ever wonder what happened to force feedback controllers that push your hands around so you can feel the action in the game as well as see it we re talking real force feedback not controllers that vibrate like pagers Somebody has a patent that s what Did you know you can t have mini games during a loading screen because of patent law Exclusive sports licenses Say goodbye to NFL football anywhere but with EA That s right they signed a deal with the NFL saying nobody could make games but them So every other pro football game including Sega s will be back to using fictional teams so get ready to play as the Dallas Zombies with all star QB Cletus Fuckhat Cashing in on Crappy Genre Knockoffs For every Grand Theft Auto there is a Driv3r For every Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic there is a Fight Club Soup Befouler This is no joke A movie goer will bitch about a movie he wasted seven bucks on But to leave 55 at the game store and find out you got a knockoff turd in return That s some serious customer dissatisfaction my friends And it will bite the industry in the ass some day unless somebody wakes up Chances of that happening Excellent I like to think that some day the businesses of the world will wake up and realize they re part of a greater whole that the energy devoted to cannabalistic infighting means ultimate doom for all The leaders of the great religions of the world will realize that all of us Muslim Christian Jew all want the same for humanity Women will realize it s the pale studious type they want instead of the quarterback of the football team and everywhere we walk bunnies will dance a path for us Dance little guys Dance 14 Don t use the online capability as an excuse to release broken games The first time we hear the word patch in relation to a PS3 or XBox 360 game we re taking the console back to the store Filled with our shit But surely the console industry always more business savvy than their PC counterparts will avoid making us gamers their unpaid beta testers Chances of that happening again depends on how many turd filled consoles they get stuck with In other words the consumer always gets exactly what they ll put up with 15 Don t use online play as an excuse to bleed us dry Imagine a world where games are streamed to your console seamlessly and quickly never having to leave your home to buy or rent games never a worry about games being out of stock never having to line up outside of a store at midnight dressed like Samus to get the next hot title Now imagine developers releasing games a few levels at a time and charging you for each Imagine games released in chapters where you never get to play the final level because the first levels didn t sell well enough Awesome The same CNN story quoted above says Microsoft also plans to greatly expand its online network in its next generation letting players and developers form their own marketplace selling in game content for real world cash via small micro transactions Racing game enthusiasts for example will be able to buy a faster car to give them an edge in the game for a slight bit more Finally we can have a game world where like the real world the rich kids have all of the cool stuff While you re fighting for 50 hours on an XBox roleplaying game to get the 50 Magical Shield of Shielding some snotty kid just went out and bought one with real world money thanks to his 150 00 weekly allowance from Daddy Chances of that happening Not even we re pessimistic enough to think they ll follow through on this Lots of bullshit gets thrown around in the online hype and speculation so we ll assume somebody misspoke there Then again you take a starving college kid and inform him that he can actually earn an income by aquiring rare video game items and selling them for actual can buy burritos with it dollars how can you stop him 16 NO MORE JUMPING PUZZLES IN FPS GAMES We ll try to be calm and avoid the violent hyperbole that spoils so many gaming websites but are you telling me that Congress can hold hearings about steroids in baseball but they can t do anything about jumping puzzles in first person games YOU CAN T SEE YOUR MOTHERFUCKING FEET IT DOESN T WORK I understand this occurring in games like Turok 3 That s why they re called bad games But Half Life 2 Are you serious BOW YOUR HEAD IN SHAME Chances that it will get bet THEY SHOULD HAVE NEVER DONE IT IN THE FIRST PLACE EVER WHOSE IDEA WAS THIS I DEMAND TO KNOW WAS IT TUROK WAS TUROK THE FIRST THE VERY FIRST FUCKING PERSON TO EVER PUT A JUMPING PUZZLE IN A FIRST FUCKING PERSON GAME SHOULD HAVE BEEN FIRED TIED DOWN AND HAD HIS EARS FILLED WITH PISS 17 Horizontal consoles have been a curse for as long as gaming has been around I m not playing another game until I get a machine I can stand on its side My entertainment center only has three inches of free space and flat consoles are the backstabbing Judas in my life Hey you re in

"http://guyism.com/sports/sports-stars-banned-from-their-sport.html"	"4357"	"{""title"":""Banned sports stars Banned athletes 9 sports stars who were banned from their sport"",""body"":""Elite athletes get banned all the time usually for shooting Miracle Gro into their veins and mostly in sports like track and field and cycling But occasionally athletes also get banned in sports that people actually care about relax just a joke bike Nazis well kind of and it is these degenerates to whom this list is dedicated Some found themselves tossed from their sport because they couldn t resist the candied lure of sweet lady cocaine while others simply got mixed up with some shady characters And while most of these athletes were banned for life a few had their sentences commuted and managed to sneak back into the league And one player on this list was just an obvious victim of hysteria and prejudice But whatever their differences they all have one thing in common at some point in the career the dudes in charge told them to get the hell out 9 Billy CoutuBilly Coutu was a defenseman who played for a decade in the early days on the NHL He even won a Stanley Cup But no one cares about any of that because Billy Coutu is known in hockey circles for one thing and one thing only for being the only player in NHL history to be banned for life for fighting Indeed Even though professional hockey has seen players beat each other with sticks put each other in the hospital and routinely throw down like wobbly drunken prize fighters hell even the goalies fight sometimes Billy Coutu took things a little too far when in the 1927 Stanley Cup Finals apparently on orders from his head coach Art Ross he started a bench clearing brawl by beating the crap out of the referee and then tackling another referee who presumably came over to break things up If this happened today they d probably put the guy in a Hannibal Lecter mask and have him publicly horsewhipped on Sportscenter 8 Roy TarpleyIn the mid to late 80s it seemed like everyone in the NBA was getting suspended for drugs A few of these players ended up getting banned for life but one of the biggest coked out fish the NBA fried was Tarpley a dominating power forward who could have gone down as one of the all time greats if he could have only kept his nose clean literally Tarpley s career was a frustrating mixture of flashes of brilliance on the court and drug addled nonsense off the court Suspended multiple times by the league because he loved the drugs and the drugs loved him Tarpley seemed like he got his act together in the mid 90s before getting busted for getting drunk which was apparently enough for the NBA to throw up their hands and tell the dude to permanently get lost 7 Dexter ManleyDexter Manley is most famous for being a dominating defensive end for those great Redskins teams of the 1980 s He s also infamous for having spent his entire career as a functional illiterate But Manley is also remembered because while he eventually conquered illiteracy he couldn t quite conquer the coke straw in time to save his career Initially banned in 1989 after testing positive for cocaine which was the third time he d been popped by the drug police he was reinstated in 1990 only to be immediately placed on waivers by the Redskins Manley then bounced around for a couple of years with the Cardinals and Buccaneers before failing a drug test for the fourth time after which the NFL exiled him to Canada where he ended his career in the CFL Oh well at least he learned to read 6 Alex GrozaDuring the 1950 s the basketball world was consumed by hysteria surrounding point shaving A lot of players and unsavory characters ended up getting booted out of basketball during this time but none more prominent than Alex Groza a star at the University of Kentucky where he was a two time All American who led the Wildcats to back to back National Championships in 1948 and 1949 Groza then went on to star in the NBA with the now defunct Indianapolis Olympians where he was an All Pro both of his years in the league Groza s career then came to an abrupt end when it came to light that he had been involved in fixing games while at Kentucky with some of his teammates The NBA immediately told him to get lost and Groza disappeared into infamy and then obscurity He eventually resurfaced as a coach and GM in the ABA before that league went under and he was forced to slink back into the shadows Alex Groza could have been one of the all time greats a basketball trailblazer remembered with contemporaries like George Mikan and Bob Cousy Instead he s remembered as maybe the best player to get banned for life from the NBA Oh well 5 Micheal Ray RichardsonMicheal Ray Richardson was along with Tarpley one of the most notable casualties of the NBA s descent into cocaine hell A supremely gifted player Richardson was capable of virtually anything on the basketball court One of the league s premier defenders Richardson led the league in steals three times He was also one of the best passers in the world matched perhaps by only Magic Johnson during his prime But Micheal Ray was also one of the most prolific cokeheads in the world leading the league in nose bleeds three times and in teeth grinding a record six times all unofficial records Finally in 1986 the league banned Richardson after he violated the NBA s drug policy for the third time The ban was eventually lifted in 1988 but Richardson never played in the NBA again instead taking his talents I m guessing aboard a barge filled with cocaine to Europe Richardson eventually failed two more tests in 1991 for cocaine what else but that didn t stop him from playing out much of the 90s for various European clubs Eventually Micheal Ray reemerged in the states as the head coach of the Albany Patroons in the CBA But since he is Micheal Ray Richardson he was eventually suspended by that league too this time not for drugs but for telling an Albany newspaper that Jews were crafty because they are hated worldwide Who knows why he said it Maybe he had been cheated out of some of his sweet sweet coke by a Rabbi I don t know Or maybe Micheal Ray Richardson just can t help being a world class f ck up and for that we salute him 4 Steve HoweSteve Howe blazed onto the baseball scene in 1980 as a hard throwing lefty reliever winning the Rookie of the Year award He then went on to save the clinching game of the 1981 World Series for the Dodgers and made the All Star team in 1982 And then shit got completely out of hand Howe checked into rehab in 1983 because he had become a cokehead and a drunk and eventually ended up missing the entire 1984 season after relapsing But that was just the start of Howe s sad journey of self destruction and chaos Over the course of his 17 year career Howe was suspended seven times yes seven for being an inveterate degenerate In 1992 MLB finally had enough and told him he was out of second chances or sixth or seventh or banning him for life but Howe managed to wriggle his way back into their good graces joining the New York Yankees where he had a couple of decent seasons pitching out of the bullpen before fading out of the league Howe s career was marked by the absurd number of chances he was given to turn it around He was even used as a punchline in a Naked Gun movie in which Leslie Nielsen s character told Anna Nicole Smith This is your last chance And I m not talking about one of those Major League Baseball Steve Howe kind of chances And finally things ended for Howe pretty much the way you d expect He was killed in a car accident in 2006 and his autopsy showed that he had meth in his system From Rookie of the Year to Leslie Nielsen punchline to methed out oblivion That s Steve Howe s legacy 3 Connie HawkinsConnie Hawkins tale is one of sad prejudice and utter hysteria A promising freshman at Iowa Hawkins was caught up in a point shaving scandal implicated even though there wasn t a shred of evidence indicating that he even knew about it His name was never mentioned by his supposed co conspirators and even more bizarrely since he was only a freshman and freshmen at that time weren t eligible to play he wasn t even on the court to do anything even if he wanted to You might as well have implicated the fans in the front row or the cheerleaders But Hawkins was young and black and an easy target for the witch hunters obsessed with the hysteria surrounding gambling in sports at the time and so he was tossed out of school and eventually blackballed by every other college and by the NBA With nowhere to turn Hawkins who was a playground legend in New York City joined the Harlem Globetrotters where he spent his prime doing dumb tricks in meaningless games Still banned by the NBA Hawkins joined the ABA when it formed in 1968 immediately becoming one of the league s premier players While he was showing everyone what they had been missing all that time Hawkins was also busy suing the NBA who eventually settled with Hawkins for 1 3 million and immediately lifted his ban His nightmarish odyssey finally at an end Hawkins joined the NBA and the Phoenix Suns where he quickly established himself as an All Star Unfortunately Hawkins career was quickly derailed by knee problems which combined with his previous decade long exile meant that his career was all too brief and that fans everywhere were robbed of his sublime talents Connie Hawkins was eventually elected to the basketball Hall of Fame but had he not been forced to spend his prime wandering the globe in minor leagues thanks to a ridiculous ban based on nothing but unfounded hysteria Hawkins would probably be remembered as one of the game s all time greats instead of as just a tragic footnote 2 Pete RoseMaybe nobody on this list is better known for his lifetime ban than Pete Rose Baseball s all time hits leader Rose was famous for his aggressive balls out style of play I mean he once ruined a dude s career when he bashed into him at home plate in an All Star game Pete Rose went all out But he was also kind of a degenerate and the dude liked to gamble Hey no big deal Who doesn t I would bet that half the people reading this and hell let s face it the person writing this too are kind of degenerates But unfortunately for Pete Rose his particular degeneracy involved betting on baseball which is probably the biggest no no there is in the sports world Anytime a player bets on his own sport people absolutely freak out and start howling like banshees about the integrity of the game But here s the thing Rose bet on his own team while he was the manager of the Cincinnati Reds So really it s not like the dude was throwing games or anything If anything it just made him bust his ass harder to win Still baseball s head honchos led by commissioner Bart Giamatti were sufficiently outraged and told Rose to get to steppin I believe those were Giamatti s exact words but I can t be entirely sure Rose has since been banned for life from baseball He s ineligible for the Hall of Fame and his legacy as baseball s hit king has been obliterated by the controversy surrounding this ban He ll always be Charlie Hustle but he ll also always be that dude on the outside looking in and that s why he s on this list 1 Shoeless Joe Jackson Shoeless Joe Jackson is probably the most famous example of an athlete banned for life from his sport A member of the infamous 1919 Chicago Black Sox team Jackson along with seven of his teammates was implicated in a conspiracy to throw the 1919 World Series Jackson was one of the best players in baseball s early days on a par with legends like Ty Cobb and Tris Speaker which is why his involvement in the scandal was such a bombshell and why he is remembered for it far more than any of his other cheating teammates How much Jackson knew or didn t know is still up for debate but what is known is that Jackson twice refused the money offered to him to throw the Series before a teammate tossed 5 000 into his hotel room which was twice Jackson s salary He also hit 375 in the World Series that year and drove in six runs so who knows Further complicating matters was an apparently fictional report in a newspaper at the time which asserted that Jackson testified in court that he purposely muffed certain plays in the field in order to throw the games a story which has been used by Jackson s detractors as the centerpiece of their argument that he was guilty But the thing is is that no such quote actually appears in the stenographic court record And that s the fuel which has powered the Shoeless Joe Jackson story all these years the bewildering mix of fact and fiction It seems like nobody then or now truly knows what the hell Joe Jackson did or didn t do in that World Series Nobody knows for sure what he even knew The White Sox s team attorney plied him with whiskey before his testimony and got the illiterate Jackson to sign an immunity waiver Years later the other seven members of the scandal admitted that Jackson was never even present during the meetings they had about throwing the Series And yet Jackson remains even in death banned for life from baseball He can t be elected to the Hall of Fame and all he is now is a sort of sad ghost relegated to legend living on only in movies like Eight Men Out and Field of Dreams Maybe he was guilty and maybe he wasn t It s almost irrelevant at this point because Shoeless Joe Jackson s name will always be synonymous with scandal and tragedy and that s why he s number one on this list Did you like this article And you probably like contests exclusive content and smug commentary right Then why aren t you liking Guyism

documentary Broke Broke the documentary that brings ESPN s outstanding 30 For 30 back tonight begins with this pair of statistics courtesy of Sports Illustrated By the time they have been retired for two years 78 percent of former NFL players have gone bankrupt or are under financial stress within five years of retirement an estimated 60 percent of former NBA players are broke The mission of Broke directed by Billy Corben is to explore the factors and there are a bunch that lead to professional athletes widely known for their very high salaries to have such a dismal record when it comes to post career financial security Nothing more than a collection of talking head interviews with former players and a few other experts in finance and sports the film starts with the obvious The root of the problem most of the speakers seem to agree is that players most often turn pro by their very early twenties right out of college if not before that They generally have no business experience Unlike people who inherit their wealth or make it in business they don t necessarily have natural connections to people who are used to handling a lot of money When you hand a 22 year old a few hundred thousand dollars it s most likely going to be spent That is not an age in which you typically find excellent long range planning skills after all Former NBA player Jamal Mashburn talks about an endorsement deal with Fila that netted him a Ferrari as a signing bonus when he says he couldn t even drive stick And then there s the extravagant spending Cars houses jewelry tailored suits the culture of active professional athletes at least in the NFL and the NBA is one that encourages excess and because it attracts such competitive and driven people some describe becoming competitively profligate which is sort of a disaster as you can imagine Remembering a fox coat he bought and wore only a couple of times NFL linebacker Bart Scott speaks not with mild regret but with well this It almost makes me look like a silverback But where the film gets more interesting is where it moves from these issues to the ones that don t necessarily come to mind first when you think about why people who have been incredibly well paid wind up broke They don t just spend money buying diamonds and cars although they buy a lot of diamonds and cars They gamble They keep having to start over in new cities if they re traded They pay high tax rates and then they pay agents and lawyers They don t remember to budget for the off season especially in the NFL which pays them week to week anyone who didn t already know that probably learned it during the NFL lockout when players who are thought of as extravagantly compensated sought loans to tide them over There are all kinds of bad decisions that go beyond extravagant purchases They agree to invest in businesses from restaurants to record labels to car washes Retired wide receiver Andre Rison is one of the film s most entertaining contributors and really knows how to bring a dry perplexed kind of delivery to a line like For some reason professional athletes got this fad with buying car washes They re subjected to straight up theft and they re hit up by friends and family As Herm Edwards a former player and coach who now does presentations for players puts it It s hard to tell people that you love no Longtime Cleveland Browns quarterback Bernie Kosar who declared bankruptcy in 2009 estimates that he was at one time or another supporting somewhere between 25 and 50 families But if you really want to lose a lot of money the fastest way might be to take the route of someone like Evander Holyfield who is said in the film to have eleven children by nine women You know what s probably more expensive than a failed car wash Eleven kids forever Child support recurs over and over again in Broke which gives an airing both to the athletes complaints that women seek them out specifically to get pregnant and get rich and to the response that you can t very well throw your athlete status around to impress women in clubs and then claim they trapped you because of your athlete status I do wish they d at least touched on the matter of birth control and whether that might be a logical way to avoid winding up supporting children you never intended to have Because if not using birth control is part of athlete culture that s noteworthy One other thing Don t forget in order to go bankrupt you don t have to lose all the money you made in a lifetime of being paid as a professional athlete You only have to lose whatever you made in your career An average NFL career is between three and four seasons You may wind up with injuries that need long term care or that inhibit your ability to work in other jobs The film becomes in part a picture of how hard it is to place your current fortunes in the context of what will become your later fortunes What 21 year old is good at thinking I m really going to need this money in 20 years if I blow out my knee What s impressive about Broke is that what starts out as a pretty simple sounding question Why do guys who live extravagantly wind up running out of money turns out to be a pretty complex one Yes they lose their money by spending it foolishly and nobody is shying away from that But they don t lose it only by spending it foolishly They lose it by being young by loving their families by mistaking a bad investment like a restaurant for a safe mature thing to do in preparation for what comes after sports Broke is ultimately a little too unstructured for me I became weary after a while from listening to the thumping music under the interview clips I d absolutely have cooled it with the music at some point because it does become distracting But the information here and the straightforwardness with which a lot of these guys offer it is fascinating The 30 For 30 series has been great at explaining the culture of sports to both fans and non fans very much including the business side The first one I ever saw was the fine King s Ransom about the trade of Wayne Gretzky to the L A Kings Like other 30 For 30 films it s streaming on Netflix and Amazon Prime Broke looks at the players side of all that money and concludes that it s surprisingly easy to lose it no matter how much you have If Mike Tyson can declare bankruptcy after all who couldn t Broke premieres Tuesday night at 8 00 p m on ESPN espn brings back its \""30 for 30\"" series with broke, which examines why professional athletes fall on hard times with such regularity after their careers end. espn brings back its \""30 for 30\"" series with broke, which examines why professional athletes fall on hard times with such regularity after their careers
